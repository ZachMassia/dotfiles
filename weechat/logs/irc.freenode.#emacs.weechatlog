2013-06-04 13:27:33	nicferrier	I think emacs could have better support for doing things quickly from the command line but it's not that bad.

2013-06-04 14:07:13	edgimar	I am trying to preview LaTeX segments in emacs (with org-mode), where I've added a +LATEX_HEADER: \input{preamble.tex} line.  But, the preview doesn't use the preamble, because it doesn't get copied to the /tmp directory (where the preview files are created/compiled).  Is there a way to handle this well (without requiring preamble.tex to be manually copied)?

2013-06-04 16:49:16	cajetanus	body produces about 100 J/s, so net heat loss  450 J/s
2013-06-04 16:49:34	tali713	cajetanus: how do you lose the heat in space?

2013-06-04 16:50:37	sawjig	tali713, you;d die from bubbles in your blood before you ever had to worry about freezing to death though
2013-06-04 16:50:38	technomancy	though the jokes aren't as good as here, on average

2013-06-04 16:52:28	cajetanus	4200 * 70 * 5 = 1470 KJ, so 1470 KJ/450 is about 1 hour
2013-06-04 16:52:32	tali713	forcer: lol.

2013-06-04 16:53:22	cajetanus	hmm. something is probably wrong with my math, but just from heat given off by your body you could last an hour in space. You'd probably die of something else before then though.
2013-06-04 16:53:24	cluck	tali713: human skin is remarkably space resistant given it evolved in a completely different environment, re: freezing, you could probably choke to death before reaching lethal core temperatures (or even hypothermia) as long as you weren't sweating much or otherwise losing mass (don't breath out, don't piss, don't shit yourself)
