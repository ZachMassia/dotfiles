2012-12-23 22:55:15	Portponky	it's spam
2012-12-23 22:55:16	+sreich	and change something

2012-12-23 22:58:16	Portponky	none of that is stuff that I would try to do
2012-12-23 22:58:27	+sreich	which parts?
2012-12-23 22:58:53	Portponky	well I wouldn't port an existing project to a different lib
2012-12-23 22:59:08	Portponky	and I wouldn't break my shaders?

2012-12-23 23:00:14	+sreich	because you aren't reading between the lines or seeing how this could apply to literally anything coding wise
2012-12-23 23:00:35	+sreich	i mean..there's kind of a reason why most projects out there use git..
2012-12-23 23:00:43	+sreich	and not just ones with a team..
2012-12-23 23:01:36	Portponky	I just don't break tons of my code all at once and get confused about it.
2012-12-23 23:01:49	+sreich	...
2012-12-23 23:02:05	+sreich	well, i can tell you're an inefficient dev then
2012-12-23 23:02:21	Portponky	I dunno, maybe I am?
2012-12-23 23:05:51	Portponky	I am still unconvinced that branching the shit out of my code so I can work on features in a nonsensical order would help me.
2012-12-23 23:06:08	+sreich	how is it a nonsensical order?
2012-12-23 23:06:16	+sreich	for example, i made a branch rendering my tilemap in a shader, and one without
2012-12-23 23:06:25	+sreich	then i decided i wanted the shader, so i merged that one in
2012-12-23 23:06:41	+sreich	doing that without branches would take way longer
2012-12-23 23:06:44	+sreich	and be more painstaking
2012-12-23 23:06:49	Portponky	Well, that's not how I would do it
2012-12-23 23:06:56	+sreich	how would you do it?
2012-12-23 23:07:08	Portponky	I would implement both and make them swappable at runtime
2012-12-23 23:07:12	+sreich	rofl
2012-12-23 23:07:16	+sreich	omglol
2012-12-23 23:07:30	Portponky	well, assuming I already had one implemented, it's just refactoring a class
2012-12-23 23:07:32	+sreich	not sure if you're trolling or...
2012-12-23 23:08:02	Portponky	why?

2012-12-23 23:08:22	+sreich	it makes 0 sense
2012-12-23 23:08:29	Portponky	well how do you do proper profiling?

2012-12-23 23:08:47	Portponky	how do you benchmark or compare them?
2012-12-23 23:08:53	+sreich	by using different branches?
2012-12-23 23:09:00	Portponky	at runtime...?
2012-12-23 23:09:08	+sreich	what?
2012-12-23 23:09:19	+sreich	i make one in one branch, another in another branch..check out the first one, compile it, benchmark it..record results
2012-12-23 23:09:22	+sreich	do the same for the 2nd one..
2012-12-23 23:09:25	Portponky	well say you find what appears to be a glitch in your tilemap shader
2012-12-23 23:09:32	+sreich	yes?
2012-12-23 23:09:56	Portponky	it's kind of handy to instantly jump back to the old one and compare?
2012-12-23 23:10:05	+sreich	that's what branches exist for..
2012-12-23 23:10:12	Portponky	... at run time..
2012-12-23 23:10:19	+sreich	why do you need it at runtime/

2012-12-23 23:11:06	Portponky	You're conflating bugfixing and profiling.
2012-12-23 23:11:30	+sreich	ok, you seem to think that to benchmark something, you need to run them both and switch them at runtime
2012-12-23 23:11:32	Portponky	So you would change your underlying render system without having a means of directly comparing the output?

2012-12-23 23:13:11	+sreich	it's determining which path to take for an approach

2012-12-23 23:35:00	Portponky	I mean they basically don't get tips at all, their tip is their wage
2012-12-23 23:35:13	Portponky	rather than going on top of their wage.
2012-12-23 23:35:24	+GTHaxor	yep, I get like $2/hr
2012-12-23 23:36:28	Portponky	f

2012-12-23 23:49:41	+GTHaxor	Yes, same
2012-12-23 23:49:42	Portponky	good move

2012-12-30 14:38:09	kenruze	there was a thirteenth grade that was phased out, I was the last year to get that
2012-12-30 14:38:24	wartech0	Here it was kintergarten, elementary, middleschool, highschool

2012-12-30 14:39:05	+slime	ah " the "middle school" concept (often grades 6-8) is a relatively new model for the mid-level grades, contrasted with the more traditional "junior high school" concept (grades 7-8 or 7-9)."
2012-12-30 14:39:18	wartech0	yea
2012-12-30 14:39:35	wartech0	but I have heard of other places putting middle school and highschool toghether

2012-12-30 14:42:26	wartech0	here is the biggest issue I have with college in the US
2012-12-30 14:42:33	wartech0	It is a damn monopoly
2012-12-30 14:42:53	wartech0	tuition has risen in the US almost every year

2012-12-30 14:43:22	kenruze	isnt it in germany where you pay for highschool and post secondary is free?
2012-12-30 14:44:08	kenruze	post secondary used to be much less expensive in canada, but tuition went up more and more as government funding was cut
2012-12-30 14:44:12	wartech0	http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76 < look at this shit..

2012-12-30 14:44:34	wartech0	not only that look at it when adjusted for inflation
2012-12-30 14:45:23	wartech0	Then that doesn't even factor in living expenses
2012-12-30 14:45:34	zebbiz	I don't get why it's only the rich who get to go to collage.
2012-12-30 14:45:55	wartech0	well the big issue here is that most people can get grants
2012-12-30 14:46:04	wartech0	The people that get hit hard
2012-12-30 14:46:07	wartech0	is the middle class
2012-12-30 14:46:15	woolite64	wartech0: It would be interesting to see (at least in recent times) how tuition fluctuates with respect to taxpayer funding. Can't find any direct sources at the moment.
2012-12-30 14:46:25	wartech0	because you are not poor enough to get grants but not rich enough to pay for college..
2012-12-30 14:46:53	wartech0	woolite64 if anything taxes have most likely gone up
2012-12-30 14:47:30	+vraid	taxes are not the same thing as taxpayer funding
2012-12-30 14:47:38	woolite64	Agreed over the whole time period, but I think lots of funding has been cut in the last few years.

2012-12-30 14:49:02	zebbiz	You guys seem like you know. Why do you have to pay for collage? Don't you want to raise the average intelligence?
2012-12-30 14:49:12	chadams	yeah, that stay even if you go bankrupt
2012-12-30 14:49:13	wartech0	from 60% in the 1960's to 30% present

2012-12-30 14:51:26	woolite64	wartech0: Not concerned about tax rates. One of the biggest problems is that when budgets get tight, education is often one of the first things to go.
2012-12-30 14:51:38	wartech0	which is stupid
2012-12-30 14:51:47	woolite64	I've been getting e-mails from the UC system all through election season about prop 30 to "avert a $250 million mid-year state budget cut that would have meant double-digit tuition increases"

2012-12-30 15:54:19	+slime	the idea with the removal of the matrix stuff from opengl was not that it wasn't useful, but that it shouldn't be handled by opengl
2012-12-30 15:54:24	+slime	even though it's necessary for most games
2012-12-30 15:54:59	+sreich	yes of course
2012-12-30 15:55:19	+slime	there are plenty of tutorials and resources about linear algebra online
2012-12-30 15:55:19	+sreich	i'm not criticizing the move away from it but rather the worlds lack of adaptation to it, insofar as the lack of tutorials..

2012-12-30 15:56:29	+slime	i don't think direct3d has its own matrix stuff, but directx might

2012-12-30 16:01:42	+slime	in terms of non-official documentation and examples, the trend i've noticed is that opengl is used by amateurs much more than directx, therefore there are a lot more non-official examples for it

2012-12-30 16:04:05	+sreich	mobiles likely have a big influence in that
2012-12-30 16:04:12	+slime	you should look at the opengl specification

2012-12-30 16:09:31	+slime	who does that?
2012-12-30 16:09:39	+slime	make a context manually, that is
2012-12-30 16:09:45	+slime	it's very, very typical to use something like SDL these days
2012-12-30 16:09:49	siponen	Who does use GLUT for a commercial project?
2012-12-30 16:09:59	siponen	:P
2012-12-30 16:10:02	+slime	no one, but people use SDL and similar all the time
2012-12-30 16:10:19	+slime	also, making a context is specific to the OS
2012-12-30 16:10:20	+slime	i.e. GLX/WGL/EGL
2012-12-30 16:10:21	+slime	/AGL
2012-12-30 16:10:31	+slime	/CGL
2012-12-30 16:10:49	siponen	So let's say this, if I want to make a lib like SDL, GLFW and so on. Where should I go, if not to literature?
2012-12-30 16:10:50	+slime	so you should look at those specifically, not opengl
2012-12-30 16:10:59	siponen	You should explain your tools
2012-12-30 16:11:00	+slime	because it's not handled by the opengl api
2012-12-30 16:11:00	+sreich	and why would you want/care?
2012-12-30 16:11:02	siponen	Really?
2012-12-30 16:11:12	+slime	as i said, WGL, GLX, CGL, EGL
2012-12-30 16:11:17	+sreich	no beginner is going to say "gee, i really want to make my context manually"

2012-12-30 16:21:03	+sreich	i think there are more important things to worry about
2012-12-30 16:21:30	+sreich	in a gui toolkit/framework usage book you don't expect to see "how you interface with the OS and write your own toolkit"
2012-12-30 16:21:40	+ExpiredPopsicle	Well, there are like a zillion different ways to do it depending on platform.
2012-12-30 16:21:40	damir__	context creation is platform dependent and is not truly about opengl
2012-12-30 16:22:20	wartech0	I am sure there is a book on winAPI
2012-12-30 16:22:21	siponen	Ofc it's dependant on the OS! Anyone can see that. It's however not an excuse, let's say you want to do opengl, all you got is the "official" book that everyone talks about. And you dont even get to know how to get a window up. :'D
2012-12-30 16:22:30	siponen	What do you think about that?

2012-12-30 16:23:57	wartech0	yea but the issue with shit like that is what if you don't want to create a context right away
2012-12-30 16:24:11	wartech0	maybe you want to display based on debug a form to fill out things such as resolution
2012-12-30 16:24:20	+ExpiredPopsicle	Or handling of multiple contexts.

2012-12-30 16:31:20	wartech0	green?
2012-12-30 16:31:24	+sreich	yay, bikeshedding!
2012-12-30 16:31:25	wartech0	everyone said shades of green on #derp
2012-12-30 16:31:26	Associat0r	you're a programmer, a technical and rational guy, you should be critical about what you use
2012-12-30 16:31:50	Associat0r	you want to build upon solid foundations if you have the chance
2012-12-30 16:32:00	Associat0r	you're a 1-man show right?
2012-12-30 16:32:10	wartech0	of course you do
2012-12-30 16:32:11	Associat0r	so no need to limit yourself to broken tools
2012-12-30 16:32:20	wartech0	But you see Associat0r
2012-12-30 16:32:22	wartech0	this is not a fact
2012-12-30 16:32:30	Associat0r	it is fact

2012-12-30 16:32:45	wartech0	YOU
2012-12-30 16:32:50	wartech0	that is

2012-12-30 16:33:00	siponen	Nah
2012-12-30 16:33:10	siponen	All of us uses F#, we just dont know it yet.
2012-12-30 16:33:11	wartech0	don't you think that is maybing saying something about your language choice?
2012-12-30 16:33:11	Associat0r	that doesn't disprove this fact
2012-12-30 16:33:21	siponen	That C++, C#, Java and Lua is just F# in disguise.
2012-12-30 16:33:22	wartech0	F# isn't the end all be all
2012-12-30 16:33:31	+sreich	i write in C++ and compile to F#
2012-12-30 16:33:33	wartech0	and it never will be
2012-12-30 16:33:36	Associat0r	wartech0: I never said that

2012-12-30 16:33:50	+sreich	and then i compile that to javascript
2012-12-30 16:33:51	+sreich	and then that to java
2012-12-30 16:34:01	+sreich	then to scheme
2012-12-30 16:34:01	wartech0	then why is it whenever we talk about design you bring up F#?
2012-12-30 16:34:01	wartech0	why
2012-12-30 16:34:11	Associat0r	wartech0: because you use .NET
2012-12-30 16:34:11	+sreich	because you haven't /ignored him yet :D

2012-12-30 16:34:22	wartech0	If we wanted to write programs in F# we wouldn't be like "oh Associat0r said we should use F#"
2012-12-30 16:34:32	wartech0	we would come to that conclusion on our own

2012-12-30 17:51:14	Sausage_	So you need help making a delay?
2012-12-30 17:51:38	gamer_	i have already implemented the delay
2012-12-30 17:51:44	gamer_	by set interval

2012-12-30 17:53:24	Sausage_	if (delta time > delay), shoot
2012-12-30 17:53:54	Sausage_	otherwise, wait
2012-12-30 17:54:23	Sausage_	When you successfully shoot
2012-12-30 17:54:44	gamer_	no 80 here is just the difference of distance between swat and fps
2012-12-30 17:54:56	Sausage_	what?
2012-12-30 17:55:14	gamer_	if distance becomes < 80 then all thhing starts up
2012-12-30 17:55:24	Sausage_	so the delay is based on distance from the player?
2012-12-30 17:55:44	woolite64	He is trying to check the distance from the enemy to the player. If you're within that distance, they should shoot you, but with a delay.
2012-12-30 17:55:46	woolite64	Is what I gathered.
2012-12-30 17:55:54	Sausage_	yeah, I think so too
2012-12-30 17:56:17	gamer_	yeap exactly
2012-12-30 17:56:25	Sausage_	With the same effect, you could create a delay time based on velocity of bullet away from bullet when created
2012-12-30 17:56:44	Sausage_	that way you don't have to check bullet positions in relation to player constantly

2012-12-30 17:57:14	Sausage_	also, your bullets should be positioned relative to the world, not the player
2012-12-30 17:57:19	Sausage_	I'd imagine
2012-12-30 17:57:58	Sausage_	so to do the delay based on distance

2012-12-30 17:59:04	Sausage_	(minimum distance / speed of bullet to be created (per sec)) = delay in seconds

2012-12-30 18:40:37	kenruze	or getting someone to pay you for your game
2012-12-30 18:41:26	Firstmate	#1
2012-12-30 18:41:36	Sausage_	ah
2012-12-30 18:41:36	kenruze	ok, so you need to make a contract
2012-12-30 18:41:46	kenruze	so you don't fight about it later
2012-12-30 18:41:46	kenruze	as much
2012-12-30 18:42:08	zebbiz	Yep, and make sure everyone is ok with it.
2012-12-30 18:42:16	kenruze	the problem is that you want to divide the money based on who did what work
2012-12-30 18:42:16	Firstmate	What will make it credible i.e. enforcable?
2012-12-30 18:42:16	kenruze	and that is hard to do
2012-12-30 18:42:26	Firstmate	We've already decided how to split it, so that's not the problem.
2012-12-30 18:42:28	kenruze	ok
2012-12-30 18:42:34	kenruze	just get everyone to sign it
2012-12-30 18:42:39	kenruze	then they have agreed legally
2012-12-30 18:42:46	zebbiz	A signature will seal the deal.
2012-12-30 18:42:46	wartech0	Firstmate, there are these things called lawyers
2012-12-30 18:42:49	kenruze	and you can use that document when you want to go to court
2012-12-30 18:42:56	kenruze	the end
2012-12-30 18:42:56	wartech0	that can draft legally sound documents
2012-12-30 18:43:06	Firstmate	LOL, I'm not stupid wartech0. Just have never done this.
2012-12-30 18:43:18	kenruze	you don't need a lawyer to agree to something
2012-12-30 18:43:26	wartech0	hah
2012-12-30 18:43:36	kenruze	make a record of the agreement
2012-12-30 18:43:36	Sausage_	The contract enforces it, the fact that it can be defended in court ensures that
2012-12-30 18:43:39	wartech0	you better make damn sure you draft that contract correctly
2012-12-30 18:43:46	kenruze	you don't even need a contract
2012-12-30 18:43:46	Firstmate	Electronic signatures are obviously okay?
2012-12-30 18:43:46	+slime	The Contract™
2012-12-30 18:44:14	wartech0	kenruze I don't know what world you are living in
2012-12-30 18:44:16	Sausage_	Gotta get that paper notarized
2012-12-30 18:44:36	wartech0	but if you do not draft a sound contract you can be screwed over
2012-12-30 18:44:57	zebbiz	Make sure everyone sign the contract and make copies of it. Keep one copy each and make sure the original is safe.
2012-12-30 18:45:06	kenruze	well if you are a group of friends (even internet friends) an agreement is probably all you need
2012-12-30 18:45:16	wartech0	nope
2012-12-30 18:45:17	wartech0	wouldn't trust people that much
2012-12-30 18:45:26	kenruze	and for the members of the group to be able to refer to what you agreed on is going to prevent most problems
2012-12-30 18:45:26	wartech0	even friends
2012-12-30 18:45:26	Sausage_	Make sure to pick trustworthy comrades too
2012-12-30 18:45:36	Firstmate	It seems a contract is the best choice.
2012-12-30 18:45:56	kenruze	also creating a formal contract for A GAME MADE BY NOVICES is overkill in 99% of cases
2012-12-30 18:46:01	wartech0	alright then you are going to need a lawyer to draft said contract
2012-12-30 18:46:08	wartech0	kenruze it protects all parties involved
2012-12-30 18:46:18	Sausage_	If there was even a slim chance my teamates would by malicious I would never work with them
2012-12-30 18:46:24	kenruze	yea, but I don't need an armed guard for my fucking sandwich
2012-12-30 18:46:28	Firstmate	This is among friends, I just want everyone to be assured they'll get their split.
2012-12-30 18:46:38	Firstmate	That's all.
2012-12-30 18:46:43	wartech0	listen money
2012-12-30 18:46:45	wartech0	changes the game
2012-12-30 18:46:57	kenruze	and everyone thinks their game is going to make a ton of it
2012-12-30 18:46:58	wartech0	I know people who I never thought would act like x
2012-12-30 18:47:10	wartech0	once they got a taste of money morals went out the window
2012-12-30 18:47:26	Firstmate	XD I know it's not going to make bank
2012-12-30 18:48:06	kenruze	if your game is closer to completion, draft a contract from your agreement
2012-12-30 18:48:19	kenruze	you cna step it up as you go
2012-12-30 18:48:24	Firstmate	As a side question, how are electronic signatures considered valid.
2012-12-30 18:48:26	kenruze	don't make a company before you have a game
2012-12-30 18:48:27	wartech0	kenruze what if x person says "I refuse to sign that"
2012-12-30 18:48:37	wartech0	Firstmate we are not lawyers
2012-12-30 18:48:57	zebbiz	Then make a redraft until he is happy.
2012-12-30 18:49:10	wartech0	zebbiz okay
2012-12-30 18:49:26	wartech0	I want 30% of profit rather then the 20% we agreed on before
2012-12-30 18:49:30	wartech0	because I feel I put more work in this game
2012-12-30 18:49:36	Firstmate	Awfully negative o.o
2012-12-30 18:49:46	zebbiz	A contract is flexible until everyone has signed it.
2012-12-30 18:49:56	wartech0	call it negativity, I call it being safe rather then being sorry
2012-12-30 18:50:06	Sausage_	I think the moral of the story is: get a contract so you don't get an asshole partner like on Indie game movie
2012-12-30 18:50:07	kenruze	armed guard for your sandwich
2012-12-30 18:50:16	Firstmate	More in regards to the comment of not being lawyers :V
2012-12-30 18:50:26	wartech0	well we aren't
2012-12-30 18:50:36	+ExpiredPopsicle	Pfft. You think indie game devs can afford lawyers?
2012-12-30 18:50:36	Firstmate	Sounds dope though, I'll get that going.
2012-12-30 18:50:48	Firstmate	Was just a simple question mate, not one asking for legal advice.
2012-12-30 18:50:56	Sausage_	420 blaze it later
2012-12-30 18:50:57	__Eric	I can afford a lawyer because my brother is one.
2012-12-30 18:50:57	__Eric	:D :D
2012-12-30 18:50:58	wartech0	ExpiredPopsicle knowing a lawyer is a good thing
2012-12-30 18:51:06	wartech0	yep see
2012-12-30 18:51:17	+ExpiredPopsicle	So even the indie scene is more about who you know than what you know, I see. =P
2012-12-30 18:51:36	__Eric	If you know anyone in a campus environment see if any of their friends arent studying to become a lawyer.
2012-12-30 18:51:37	__Eric	get to know that person
2012-12-30 18:51:48	Sausage_	psh, I won't need one
2012-12-30 18:51:56	wartech0	ExpiredPopsicle of course it is
2012-12-30 18:51:57	wartech0	everything is about who you know
2012-12-30 18:52:06	wartech0	building social connections
2012-12-30 18:52:16	__Eric	We're people using other people as resources, so connections are important :)
2012-12-30 18:52:17	kenruze	that's why I'm here i think

2012-12-30 18:52:36	Sausage_	I'm here so I can spend less time actually doing things

2012-12-30 19:18:09	MrBushido	the nice thing about fbx is that it seems to be pretty well documented even if i'm not going to use the sdk directly
2012-12-30 19:18:28	+ExpiredPopsicle	Everything exports it in a different way. And implementing the whole spec even WITH the official API is an ridicuously large task.
2012-12-30 19:18:48	kenruze	does obj support bone weights?

2012-12-30 20:10:32	+slime	why would you ditch the projection one?
2012-12-30 20:10:50	Portponky	I would recommend get a cheapy telescope and see how you find it. even a cheap ~$50 one should get you to see some stuff
2012-12-30 20:10:50	+slime	it transforms stuff to clip-space
2012-12-30 20:11:00	wartech0	idk
2012-12-30 20:11:10	Portponky	but if you can't be fucked going outside on a clear night and dicking around with it, then its not for you

2012-12-30 20:12:40	Portponky	it's a lot better to see it for real.
2012-12-30 20:12:40	wartech0	think of projection like this if I draw a cube that is 1 x 1 x 1
2012-12-30 20:12:52	Portponky	Like, you can look at pics of the grand canyon on the net, but it's not exactly the same as going there
2012-12-30 20:13:00	wartech0	project makes it so it matches up to the view if you get what I mean
2012-12-30 20:13:21	+slime	projection also transforms stuff into the homogenius clip space ([-1..1] coordinates in GL), afaik
2012-12-30 20:13:40	+slime	homogeneous
2012-12-30 20:14:10	wartech0	its like the difference between orthographic view and non-orthographic sreich

2012-12-30 20:14:50	wartech0	what? the project matrices doesn't handle that?
2012-12-30 20:14:51	wartech0	projection*
2012-12-30 20:15:00	+slime	the perspective transformation does turn stuff from a frustum into a cube, but it also transforms the coordinates into homogeneous clip space
2012-12-30 20:15:50	wartech0	slime you mean when I render a cube without a projection matrix it looks like a rectangle?
2012-12-30 20:15:51	wartech0	instead of a cube
2012-12-30 20:17:10	wartech0	slime?

2012-12-30 20:45:51	wartech0	Java easy
2012-12-30 20:45:54	siponen	<3 math
2012-12-30 20:46:01	wartech0	VB I didn't even care enough to show up to
2012-12-30 20:46:11	wartech0	Intro to CS is the only class I would go to and pay attention to
2012-12-30 20:46:31	__Eric	wartech0 sounds like you've some commitment issue going on.
2012-12-30 20:46:41	wartech0	Why learn things I already know

2012-12-30 20:47:22	wartech0	also why do I need to drive for 45 minutes to classes I already know, and then drive back
2012-12-30 20:47:41	+vraid	so i went on to study math at university, but then i was like uhhu university, fuck it :P
2012-12-30 20:47:42	__Eric	wartech0 that's the great thing about life: You don't have to do anything.
2012-12-30 20:48:21	wartech0	its not only a problem for me though __Eric
2012-12-30 20:48:22	wartech0	its a problem for everyone

2012-12-30 20:48:41	wartech0	vraid yes I live far away
2012-12-30 20:49:03	wartech0	__Eric the people coming out of community college and hitting university level CS classes are screwed
2012-12-30 20:49:22	siponen	Education isn't that important though, as long you can self study in a lot of the areas on your own.
2012-12-30 20:49:33	wartech0	it is for that tiny slip of paper
2012-12-30 20:49:47	wartech0	that says no more then "I am good at school"
2012-12-30 20:50:02	wartech0	it doesn't say "I am a badass programmer"

2012-12-30 20:50:52	siponen	But their programming courses were a bit of a lackluster though.
2012-12-30 20:51:02	siponen	and the rest of the theory part.

2012-12-30 20:52:12	wartech0	okay lets look at it this way, 90% of the people who started in CS dropped
2012-12-30 20:52:22	wartech0	and this is the funny part, a lot of them thought it was too hard
2012-12-30 20:52:52	siponen	But how many of them?
2012-12-30 20:53:04	siponen	From my impressions it's more that the program didnt meet up to their expectations.
2012-12-30 20:53:32	wartech0	its because of admissions
2012-12-30 20:53:52	wartech0	kid comes in "I want to work with computers" network class is full
2012-12-30 20:53:54	wartech0	Computer science yea do that!

2012-12-30 20:54:32	wartech0	I explicitly stated CS several times
2012-12-30 20:54:42	wartech0	and I was one of the few that actually knew wtf I was getting into
2012-12-30 20:55:24	wartech0	so much that I took one of my good friends Chaosgrunt (who was in here a couple days ago) and taught him C++
2012-12-30 20:55:40	wartech0	by the time we hit the actual class we bothed breezed through it

2013-04-21 21:25:54	xto	What do you prefer? Learn DX making own samples... => Write a pseudo game engine renderer and make own game => finally start with my own proffesional game engine (long term project)
2013-04-21 21:26:06	wartech0	MrBushido thats the route I take
2013-04-21 21:26:09	+sreich	well the latter will most definitely fail, so there's that.
2013-04-21 21:26:16	MrBushido	they both succeed at what they attempt, and directx even more so in the sense of its popularity among AAA studios
2013-04-21 21:26:18	wartech0	I don't think DX will fail

2013-04-21 21:26:50	MrBushido	but opengl isn't without its own merit since it allows for deviations in hardware specs by allowing vendor extensions
2013-04-21 21:26:59	wartech0	learning that is better then knowing DX, Opengl
2013-04-21 21:27:01	MrBushido	neither is going to fail
2013-04-21 21:27:07	MrBushido	it's like vi vs emacs
2013-04-21 21:27:09	+sreich	nobody said it was going to fail
2013-04-21 21:27:12	MrBushido	or windows vs linux
2013-04-21 21:27:16	wartech0	besides graphics programming is graphics programming
2013-04-21 21:27:19	MrBushido	or firefox vs ie vs chrome

2013-04-21 21:27:38	xto	if you want make an engine
2013-04-21 21:27:48	wartech0	You don't want to make a engine

2013-04-21 21:28:10	MrBushido	sreich: you say that but!
2013-04-21 21:28:12	xto	i dont think so...
2013-04-21 21:28:16	xto	i have motivation
2013-04-21 21:28:18	+sreich	could someone explain to him?
2013-04-21 21:28:22	wartech0	Because engine dev is like the hardest thing you can do

2013-04-21 21:28:25	+sreich	"busy"
2013-04-21 21:28:31	+sreich	oh yeah and is this a 3d engine?
2013-04-21 21:28:35	xto	i am not going to create next udk or cryengine
2013-04-21 21:28:37	+sreich	if so multiply that by 9999999x
2013-04-21 21:28:38	MrBushido	it depends on what your engine is for
2013-04-21 21:28:40	xto	i know it is impossible for me...
2013-04-21 21:28:48	MrBushido	if you're trying to make an engine that has the same features as udk
2013-04-21 21:28:49	MrBushido	then yes
2013-04-21 21:28:53	MrBushido	you are probably going to fail
2013-04-21 21:28:57	xto	...no
2013-04-21 21:29:01	xto	not like udk
2013-04-21 21:29:02	wartech0	No just making a general good engine is hard
2013-04-21 21:29:05	wartech0	okay okay
2013-04-21 21:29:09	xto	just for education <=
2013-04-21 21:29:12	MrBushido	but if you're making a board game engine, thats a sensible goal
2013-04-21 21:29:13	wartech0	make a GOOD 2d engine
2013-04-21 21:29:20	MrBushido	or an top down rpg engine
2013-04-21 21:29:27	wartech0	engines by their nature can be used for any game
2013-04-21 21:29:37	MrBushido	thats a lie

2013-04-21 21:29:43	MrBushido	an engine is tech
2013-04-21 21:29:54	xto	Some engines have problems with switch indoor - outdoor
2013-04-21 21:30:02	wartech0	a engine encompasses audio, graphics, physics, input
2013-04-21 21:30:09	xto	i know
2013-04-21 21:30:10	wartech0	That is it
2013-04-21 21:30:14	wartech0	Its not a game
2013-04-21 21:30:16	MrBushido	yes, but that doesnt mean it can be used to make any game
2013-04-21 21:30:19	MrBushido	the engine can be specific
2013-04-21 21:30:20	xto	i created pseudo game engine
2013-04-21 21:30:26	xto	it has input, audio, physics and so on...
2013-04-21 21:30:28	wartech0	That is a shit engine then MrBushido
2013-04-21 21:30:34	xto	but this is a shit...
2013-04-21 21:30:46	xto	I know how game engine works...
2013-04-21 21:30:47	MrBushido	wartech0: wtf are you on about
2013-04-21 21:30:57	MrBushido	you were just saying making a general purpose engine is a bad idea
2013-04-21 21:31:04	MrBushido	and now you're saying a specialised engine is a shit engine
2013-04-21 21:31:04	wartech0	A engine is supposed to be generic and general purpose
2013-04-21 21:31:13	fullmetalgurren	why?
2013-04-21 21:31:16	MrBushido	can you stay focused if you're going to troll me ;P
2013-04-21 21:31:17	wartech0	If its not that it is not a engine
2013-04-21 21:31:31	MrBushido	its not supposed to at all
2013-04-21 21:31:34	fullmetalgurren	but maybe the creator needs a *special* engine
2013-04-21 21:31:37	MrBushido	an engine is a game without content
2013-04-21 21:31:53	wartech0	Disagree
2013-04-21 21:31:53	xto	there are very diffrents architectures

2013-04-21 21:32:03	wartech0	a game without content is a game without content
2013-04-21 21:32:09	wartech0	Not a engine
2013-04-21 21:32:16	xto	you can create IRenderObject or IEntity
2013-04-21 21:32:43	wartech0	The specifics of the 'engine' in a game are geared towards that game, not general purpose use
2013-04-21 21:32:58	xto	Making home-made game engine architecture it is not so important...

2013-04-21 21:33:20	xto	what i just said...
2013-04-21 21:33:37	wartech0	You seem to be confusing the word engine with inner workings of a game
2013-04-21 21:33:46	wartech0	the two are not synomous
2013-04-21 21:33:49	xto	If you making a home-made game engine then architecture is not so important
2013-04-21 21:34:17	Tili_us	xto: I tend to agree.
2013-04-21 21:34:36	xto	There are 2. types of people making their own home-made engines:
2013-04-21 21:35:04	xto	1. First group make a big architecture, many classes and never finish their engine...
2013-04-21 21:35:06	+slime	wartech0: an engine does not have to be general-purpose to be classified as an engine
2013-04-21 21:35:10	wartech0	xto you don't even know DirectX or Opengl how can you speak from a body of knowledge about these things
2013-04-21 21:35:17	+slime	lol...
2013-04-21 21:35:33	xto	2. Second group make a shit (not engine)...
2013-04-21 21:35:43	wartech0	slime that is the defination I normally encounter
2013-04-21 21:35:53	xto	They just put input, graphics and call it engine ...

2013-04-21 21:36:55	wartech0	I think you are confused about what I am saying
2013-04-21 21:36:57	fullmetalgurren	by that definition whether an engine is general or not is irrelevant
2013-04-21 21:37:07	xto	The most AAA game engines can be probably used for
2013-04-21 21:37:16	xto	FPS, racing games only
2013-04-21 21:37:17	wartech0	Engines, like libraries, need to be written with the up most reusability

2013-04-21 21:53:55	Tili_us	isn't it abstract because of the virtual and the  " = o;" part?
2013-04-21 21:54:06	wartech0	yes a pure virtual function
2013-04-21 21:54:11	wartech0	I wouldn't say abstract
2013-04-21 21:54:11	+tracekill	0
2013-04-21 21:54:30	+tracekill	The class is described as abstract.
2013-04-21 21:54:31	+tracekill	Not the function.
2013-04-21 21:54:40	Tili_us	well you cant make an instance of a class with that kinda of a function
2013-04-21 21:54:50	wartech0	tracekill that isn't C++ though
2013-04-21 21:54:54	+tracekill	No it's abstract, hence why I said an abstract class.
2013-04-21 21:54:56	wartech0	there is no concept of a abstract class
2013-04-21 21:55:03	+tracekill	wartech0 yes there is, it's just implied.
2013-04-21 21:55:17	recast	Has anyone asked #geordi to get geordi in #reddit-gamedev?
2013-04-21 21:55:24	recast	Would make this discussion pretty short
2013-04-21 21:56:06	wartech0	Its only abstract in the idea that it has function declerations that are defined in a derived class
2013-04-21 21:56:13	wartech0	that is all a pure virtual function is
2013-04-21 21:56:23	Tili_us	any class with one or more pure virtual functions becomes an abstract base class
2013-04-21 21:56:25	wartech0	if you have one pure virtual function then that class HAS TO BE derived
2013-04-21 21:56:26	+tracekill	That's what an abstract class is too.
2013-04-21 21:56:28	+tracekill	YAY.

2013-04-21 21:56:37	jpetrie	wartech0: no
2013-04-21 21:56:51	jpetrie	you simply cannot instantiate it
2013-04-21 21:56:58	wartech0	Right
2013-04-21 21:57:07	+kiwibonga	http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1cu4u8/heres_how_you_avoid_copyright_infringement_in/
2013-04-21 21:57:08	+tracekill	That's not what you said.
2013-04-21 21:57:11	wartech0	to instantiate it, it must be derived from
2013-04-21 21:57:11	+tracekill	He's clarifying.
2013-04-21 21:57:12	+kiwibonga	upvote more
2013-04-21 21:57:13	jpetrie	that's different from requiring there to be a derived class
2013-04-21 21:57:35	wartech0	What good is a class that cannot be instantiated?
2013-04-21 21:58:02	wartech0	Sorry I thought that was implied
2013-04-21 21:58:04	Tili_us	wartech0: its a good base class
2013-04-21 21:58:06	+tracekill	A class that is implemented in a delayed linked lib.
2013-04-21 21:58:29	+tracekill	Maybe...
2013-04-21 21:58:35	jpetrie	wartech0: just because something is useful or not isn't really the point
2013-04-21 21:58:57	wartech0	jpetrie well I made the assumption that we already knew that
2013-04-21 21:59:02	wartech0	I didn't think it needed to be said
2013-04-21 21:59:25	+tracekill	Wait jpetrie, so if I have a class that declares "friend class AbstractBase;" do the classes inheriting from that AbstractBase automatically become friends as well?
2013-04-21 21:59:39	wartech0	No
2013-04-21 21:59:48	+tracekill	Why?
2013-04-21 21:59:58	wartech0	<jpetrie> friendship isn't transitive, reflexive or inherited.
2013-04-21 22:00:04	Tili_us	tracekill: no that would screw up the score and security of the code.
2013-04-21 22:00:18	jpetrie	C++ says so, basically.
2013-04-21 22:00:25	+tracekill	Yeah that's a shitty reason.
2013-04-21 22:00:25	Tili_us	tracekill: I cant type anymore. *scope
2013-04-21 22:00:41	Tili_us	it would defeat stuff like private or public

2013-04-21 22:01:19	Tili_us	tracekill: yes indeed, but you control who your friends are
2013-04-21 22:01:30	jpetrie	tracekill: 11.4.10 of the C++ standard.
2013-04-21 22:01:45	jpetrie	"Friendship is neither inherited nor transitive."
2013-04-21 22:02:27	+tracekill	God dammit... jpetrie alright how about design patterns in C++ that would give me similar functionality?

2013-04-21 22:02:27	Tili_us	tracekill: what exactly do you need?
2013-04-21 22:02:52	jpetrie	You have class X, and abstract class A. And you want A and it's children to be able to access the private members of X?
2013-04-21 22:02:54	+tracekill	Exactly yeah.
2013-04-21 22:03:09	Tili_us	hmm
2013-04-21 22:03:42	+tracekill	Specifically X is a CUDA context, A is a Kernel wrapper and it's children would be specific kernel implementations.
2013-04-21 22:03:43	wartech0	tracekill its kinda side stepping the issue a bit, but you could declare smaller classes that have a object exist in children defining some common members between each child, make that class a friend class
2013-04-21 22:03:46	Tili_us	I dont know of a way tbh
2013-04-21 22:04:27	+tracekill	wartech0 the children have no relation to eachother.
2013-04-21 22:04:27	MrBushido	shitty low res game of thrones eps up on tpb
2013-04-21 22:04:27	MrBushido	wtb 720p :<
2013-04-21 22:04:27	jpetrie	Is the set of manipulations to X done by A fixed? If so, you could put a protected interface on A that its children can use
2013-04-21 22:04:27	Tili_us	tracekill: is this something you can do in other languages?
2013-04-21 22:04:42	jpetrie	tbh I try to avoid clever friendships
2013-04-21 22:05:02	jpetrie	(it just works better if I'm the smartest person in any given relationship)
2013-04-21 22:05:27	+tracekill	Tili_us yeah, in a way.
2013-04-21 22:05:31	Tili_us	jpetrie: hahaaa
2013-04-21 22:05:33	jpetrie	But in this case, I might consider just making all of X public or otherwise altering its API to make what you want to do a sanctioned operation.
2013-04-21 22:05:41	+tracekill	jpetrie, would you mind doing a real quick pastebin of that set up?
2013-04-21 22:06:02	wartech0	tracekill maybe figure out what exactly x needs, write functions for A's children to handle said obtaining of data
2013-04-21 22:06:04	Tili_us	jpetrie: I am curious of the implementation, but I would not use it...
2013-04-21 22:06:31	+tracekill	wartech0, that doesn't make any sense for my purposes.
2013-04-21 22:07:23	+tracekill	I'm thinking I might be able to use a nested class definition.
2013-04-21 22:08:10	wartech0	I don't know I normally go the route of strictly defined interfaces, you would have to write one for each child though
2013-04-21 22:08:22	wartech0	its not a very generic way to the problem
2013-04-21 22:08:22	Tili_us	is it too much work too explicitly make all the subclasses friend manually?
2013-04-21 22:08:32	jpetrie	I just mean something like http://ideone.com/q3ZKj2
2013-04-21 22:08:37	wartech0	That seems dirty Tili_us
2013-04-21 22:08:37	+tracekill	Well it would defeat the purpose of making the ineraction generic.

2013-04-21 22:09:13	Tili_us	thanks MrBushido
2013-04-21 22:09:14	+tracekill	Tili_us, really what I'm asking is analogous to how Effects wrap shaders and interact with a rendering context.
2013-04-21 22:09:29	+sreich	wartech0: i need a bee hive and i need honeycomb
2013-04-21 22:09:29	wartech0	oh jpetrie that is a pretty good idea
2013-04-21 22:09:29	+tracekill	So I guess I might be able to check some of those, only openCL kernels don't outwardly declare their params.
2013-04-21 22:09:31	+sreich	what's the best way to kill a beehive thing?
2013-04-21 22:09:44	+sreich	without dying, that is
2013-04-21 22:09:44	wartech0	sreich run up hit the hive and run away
2013-04-21 22:09:53	wartech0	try to get one bee following you
2013-04-21 22:10:13	wartech0	then just take them out 1 by 1
2013-04-21 22:10:13	jpetrie	I could probably give you a better, higher-level solution if I knew more about OpenCL, but I've never really looked at it.
2013-04-21 22:10:14	+tracekill	OpenGL?
2013-04-21 22:10:28	wartech0	jpetrie I am totally going to grab this for future use
2013-04-21 22:10:48	jpetrie	Oh, I meant CUDA I guess
2013-04-21 22:11:14	+tracekill	I mean, yes I'm using OpenCL, but if you've done like shader abstraction it would be similar, I suppose.
2013-04-21 22:11:14	+tracekill	jpetrie, oh no I was just asking if you'd done OpenGL.
2013-04-21 22:11:14	jpetrie	Oh, yeah.
2013-04-21 22:11:44	jpetrie	Well, approach I take in shader wrappers is tied somewhat to my approach for implementation-hiding in general.
2013-04-21 22:12:15	wartech0	You could do some sort of shader reflection
2013-04-21 22:12:15	+tracekill	(07:09:06 PM) tracekill: So I guess I might be able to check some of those, only openCL kernels don't outwardly declare their params.
2013-04-21 22:12:15	wartech0	It would be a bitch though
2013-04-21 22:12:20	jpetrie	So you could take that approach as well, but it's a bit more engineering.
2013-04-21 22:13:23	Tili_us	well gnight folks!
2013-04-21 22:13:43	wartech0	night
2013-04-21 22:13:45	jpetrie	That approach involves a public API that uses CRTP to inherit from an opaque private implementation.
2013-04-21 22:13:45	+tracekill	jpetrie, hey you're the only one with ideas. How does the generic wrapper for a shader look in your system and how do you extend it to fit an individual shader implementation?

2013-04-21 22:18:24	jpetrie	The private layer contains all the private implementations of the public APIs, but because the private implementations are never accessible outside the API itself, the private implementations can use public/private to control access
2013-04-21 22:18:24	jpetrie	Something that is "public" in the private layer is only accessible to the rest of the private layer
2013-04-21 22:18:24	jpetrie	Now, for shaders specifically, I don't have subclasses to represent different effects - it's all data-driven.
2013-04-21 22:18:24	+tracekill	WELL FUCK
2013-04-21 22:18:24	+tracekill	Though thanks for CRTP this is rather cool.
2013-04-21 22:18:24	jpetrie	But if I were going to do that, I'd just have the base shader API expose a method or set of methods for returning some structure describing all parameters
2013-04-21 22:18:24	jpetrie	That could be as simple as a map.
2013-04-21 22:18:34	wartech0	It would be really awesome to just hand a program a shader file and it would hand back a cpp file describing how to interface with said shader
2013-04-21 22:19:03	wartech0	Even better if you could compile it and some how jury rig it into the program during runtime
2013-04-21 22:19:05	jpetrie	http://codepad.org/ELJ1mSTy for example
2013-04-21 22:19:12	+tracekill	Yeah I'd thought of building a param map but virtually all of the kernel parameters are buffers. I guess that doesn't prevent that but I was sort of hoping the Kernel class could implement a "set up" function that has access to the Context's private members.
2013-04-21 22:19:30	jpetrie	You may be able to leverage the vistor pattern then
2013-04-21 22:19:47	+tracekill	wartech0, there already exists runtime compilation of shader programs.
2013-04-21 22:20:46	+tracekill	Ah! Yes! You might be right about that jpetrie.
2013-04-21 22:22:05	jpetrie	Between a specialized visitor implementation, and an implementation-hiding technique like the one I described, you can probably get to what you need.
2013-04-21 22:22:51	jpetrie	I guess strictly the implementation-hiding isn't needed but it might result in a cleaner API for people who aren't directly implementing new kernels

2013-04-21 22:24:29	+tracekill	Ah see, the issue with your shader example is that I don't need the Kernel to expose the parameters, it needs to keep those internally. But in order to allocate space for those parameters, it needs the device context which is a private member of another class.
2013-04-21 22:25:32	jpetrie	Couldn't you just give the Kernel a reference to that class as a dependency then? Then subclasses can use it to allocate that memory

2013-04-21 23:20:16	+sreich	it's not even anything really
2013-04-21 23:20:52	+sreich	e.g. in every movie they show men and women getting it on
2013-04-21 23:20:57	+sreich	just that brokeback mountain doesn't show anything
2013-04-21 23:21:48	+sreich	just like kissing and a bit of hump action. the rest is just dialog or whatever
2013-04-21 23:21:48	+sreich	(humping where you don't see anything but clothes, that is)
2013-04-21 23:23:28	+sreich	damnit berry bushes feel like they take forever to grow
2013-04-21 23:23:43	wartech0	did you put poop on them
2013-04-21 23:23:44	+sreich	yeah
2013-04-21 23:23:46	wartech0	okay

2013-04-21 23:27:23	Satimidus	Putting poop on berries? Everyone knows only unicorn feces actually increment growth rates.

2013-04-21 23:29:17	+sreich	and here is the aftermath:
2013-04-21 23:29:17	+sreich	of the entire fucking forest
2013-04-21 23:29:21	Satimidus	I should shave more often, but I get lazy ^^;;;

2013-04-21 23:30:49	Satimidus	'r/gamedev'. I shoulda known you weren't just making up things.
2013-04-21 23:31:34	+sreich	i think i can still salvage this situation.
2013-04-21 23:31:34	+justicefries	sreich: are you enjoying it?
2013-04-21 23:31:34	+sreich	the good news is that there was a road thing at the other end of the forest that divided another forest
2013-04-21 23:31:49	+sreich	so i can still get all the wood i can eat
2013-04-21 23:31:54	+justicefries	i had an unexpected large expense and so I shouldn't be buying that until Friday. :(
2013-04-21 23:32:19	+sreich	yeah it's pretty awesome
2013-04-21 23:32:24	+sreich	though i tweaked the world so that more things spawn and less bad guys spawn
2013-04-21 23:33:39	wartech0	sreich you can do that to protect your base as well
2013-04-21 23:33:39	+sreich	shitload of bees though
2013-04-21 23:33:39	wartech0	put a road around it
2013-04-21 23:33:39	+sreich	otherwise it's too hard for me and i don't like frustration

2013-04-22 00:13:05	Xardov	and please no language bashing =D
2013-04-22 00:13:18	+sreich	lol
2013-04-22 00:13:21	hg341	java is easy c++...

2013-04-22 00:13:43	wartech0	Java is no where near synmous to c++
2013-04-22 00:13:45	+sreich	if you start with C++ then C++ is easy ;)
2013-04-22 00:13:53	wartech0	Exactly
2013-04-22 00:13:54	hg341	no i said that wrong i meant java easy / c++ very hard
2013-04-22 00:13:56	+sreich	or at least it is for me.

2013-04-22 00:14:40	wartech0	suck?
2013-04-22 00:14:45	wartech0	or its really low level?
2013-04-22 00:14:50	+sreich	kinda depends on what they mean
2013-04-22 00:15:08	+sreich	some container functionailty bugs me sometimes, but that's just because i'm used to Qt
2013-04-22 00:15:10	+sreich	which has a great design

2013-04-22 00:18:38	+sreich	no no no no
2013-04-22 00:18:44	+sreich	the right answer is F#
