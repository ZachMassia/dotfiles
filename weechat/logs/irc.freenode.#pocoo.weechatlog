2013-02-17 18:35:48	__Gabe__	yes but you still have to write all of the tags, style, events and so on
2013-02-17 18:36:49	__Gabe__	this will generate it for you, and if you choose external css it will compare all the settings and reduce class's also.  It gets the class for the tag from your python class, and all the style and attributes as well.  you just nest classes as if you where writing python
2013-02-17 18:37:32	dAnjou	__Gabe__: isn't that what SASS is for?
2013-02-17 18:38:00	shiver	i've always found myself trying to decouple the view and UI details from the logic as much as possible
2013-02-17 18:38:10	__Gabe__	shiver i agree

2013-02-17 18:41:19	shiver	only way to find out is to push it out and see what the response is

2013-02-17 18:44:43	shiver	__Gabe__, is that not where web development started out? with CGI and similar until MVC became the accepted better alternative?
2013-02-17 18:45:19	shiver	i agree that html, css and javascript are a mixture of completely different things and having just one common codebase seems ideal
2013-02-17 18:45:29	shiver	but i think in practice it becomes very difficult to do well
2013-02-17 18:45:45	shiver	but if you think you can do it, like i said, push it out
2013-02-17 18:45:50	__Gabe__	Im sure, but as long as it works for me its all that matters

2013-02-17 18:50:43	__Gabe__	Then when i learn it, i get bored with it and end up not finishing it

2013-02-17 18:51:15	shiver	and when you have deadlines it becomes problematic

2013-02-17 20:41:29	midnightcoffee	i'm trying to extend flask-admin with a function that loads data into the database. Its very possible i should be going about this another way, but in my current setup i can't seem to change the default of expose away from 'GET' to 'POST'. rough view: http://bpaste.net/show/77974/,  jinja2: http://bpaste.net/show/77975/, html source: http://bpaste.net/show/3QzzScWIYb0xKBGGerjF/.

2013-02-17 23:39:00	bkmz	1st question. Why PostsModelView doesn't represent author model field automatic? And why in this scenario, when i click on submit i get the error: InvalidRequestError: This Session's transaction has been rolled back due to a previous exception during flush. To begin a new transaction with this Session, first issue Session.rollback(). Original exception was: (InterfaceError) Error binding parameter 3 - probably unsupported type. u'INSER

2013-02-17 23:56:14	asdf`	bkmz, what if you have a `author` relationship in your Post model, not just a pk? it's nicer to use that way anyway. You'd spell it like `class Post(db.Model): author_id = db.Column('author', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id')); author = db.relationship("User")`

2013-02-18 00:04:26	asdf`	bkmz, the name of the db column doesn't need to be the same as the name of the model attribute. It's `author_this_is_in_model = db.Column('author_this_is_db_column_name', db.Integer)`
2013-02-18 00:05:17	asdf`	the other thing is a "relationship", ie. a sqlalchemy thing. You can do `myPost.author = myUserModel` and then sqlalchemy will see you're setting a relationship and will find and update the fk field

My code wa (i changed it sense then), http://bpaste.net/show/78224/ creating a DetachedInstanceError. So i decided to just store the id. Now i'm finding that to be cumbersome. Whats recommended?
