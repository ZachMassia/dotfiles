2013-01-02 00:41:45	kisielk__	got to start working on booting my brain back up this week
2013-01-02 00:41:54	kisielk__	took some time off to do manual labour instead

2013-01-02 00:43:20	nsf	most likely just cgo flags and stuff
2013-01-02 00:43:25	davecheney	nsf: unless Go-SDL calls pkg-config
2013-01-02 00:43:31	nsf	that's cgo flags
2013-01-02 00:43:50	nsf	you can replace pkg-config with CFLAGS and LDFLAGS

2013-01-02 00:44:30	nsf	but you'll need to build SDL with mingw/msys first anyway
2013-01-02 00:44:31	davecheney	there is an issue to allow the go tool to work without source
2013-01-02 00:44:33	nsf	and perhaps it has pkg-config :D
2013-01-02 00:44:40	davecheney	i wonder if that was fixed, it would be easier to solve these problems
2013-01-02 00:45:01	davecheney	nsf: i thought pkg-config was some gnome thing
2013-01-02 00:45:10	davecheney	glibc
2013-01-02 00:45:10	nsf	no

2013-01-02 00:45:50	nsf	dir /usr/lib/pkgconfig contains a lot of .pc files

2013-01-02 00:46:03	nsf	nothing fancy at all
2013-01-02 00:46:09	+Namegduf	glibc isn't a GNOME thing either
2013-01-02 00:46:21	 *	davecheney stops talking about stuff he knows little about
2013-01-02 00:46:40	+Namegduf	Might be a confusion between glib (GNOME thing) and glibc (GNU libc, one of the C standard library implementations for Linux, probably the most important)

2013-01-02 00:47:21	+Namegduf	pkg-config is basically a library build flag autoconfiguration tool added as an additional layer on top of the existing autoconf tools when they weren't working well.

2013-01-02 00:48:10	nsf	I don't know, imho pkg-config has nothing to do with autotools
2013-01-02 00:48:22	+Namegduf	It doesn't have anything to do with autotools, aside being commonly used with it
2013-01-02 00:48:45	davecheney	i see
2013-01-02 00:48:50	+Namegduf	It's another instance of the same approach of "add another program to autogenerate the build instructions for the previous program"
2013-01-02 00:49:00	davecheney	similar to the way alcohol and cigarettes are commonly found together
2013-01-02 00:49:20	nsf	anyways, http://ompldr.org/vZ3ZyOA (tcl/tk go bindings running on windows 7)
2013-01-02 00:49:30	+Namegduf	Sorta, but when they're used together they interact.
2013-01-02 00:50:23	+Namegduf	pkg-config is reasonably sane in and of itself, doing a reasonably complete job.

2013-01-12 04:26:39	fgb	I'd look at old cgi scripts for examples...
2013-01-12 04:28:37	taruti	so is e.g. handling of files named "COM1" fixed?
2013-01-12 04:29:27	DisposaBoy	what's COM1 and bug are we talking about
2013-01-12 04:29:37	taruti	\\.\ needs also escaping.

2013-08-11 12:27:24	PatrickB	quick question -  I want to have a helper function for logging that log enter/exit messages then call a user-provided func literal so I'd get an enter msg, the user code would execute (itself also logging), then an exit msg.
2013-08-11 12:27:32	PatrickB	The problem is, I want users to be able to use this logging 'scope' function anywhere as a straight wrapper around any blocks of their code - wrapping key functions for eg.  Users might call it like xxx.Scope("msg...", data...)(func() { [their regular code] }).  So the scope function returns a func that takes the user func as an arg - wrapping it in enter/exit logic.
2013-08-11 12:27:40	PatrickB	This works all fine and we'll, until the user wants to return from within that closure.  It's a return from the closure, not a return for the containing function so the return parameters are defined by the func literal I define as the parameter to the function.  Ruby's block support handles this - but I don't see an obvious way to handle it in Go.  Is there any way of doing this?
2013-08-11 12:27:44	PatrickB	trivial example: http://play.golang.org/p/LWG5c7U3ve
2013-08-11 12:28:35	tux21b	BratSinot, your browser requests the page specified by the action parameter of the form element when you click on a submit button on a html page. You simply need to accept requests for that page too in your application

2013-08-11 12:30:12	nsf	it does things like that:
2013-08-11 12:30:14	nsf	defer un(trace(p, "Statement"))
2013-08-11 12:30:20	nsf	at the beginning of the function

2013-08-11 13:52:04	+skelterjohn_	xtg: the parsing step is slower than the decoding step
2013-08-11 13:52:07	+skelterjohn_	the decoding is O(n)

2013-08-11 13:52:29	steffkes	ty dominikh, skelterjohn_ let's see how that goes :)
2013-08-11 13:52:48	moraes	at least, it is the most popular frameworky go thing on github
2013-08-11 13:52:53	moraes	i have no idea how it is though
2013-08-11 13:52:55	+skelterjohn_	steffkes: definitely come back and ask around if you have pain points
2013-08-11 13:52:59	dominikh	revel is also as anti-Go as it can get
2013-08-11 13:53:06	steffkes	skelterjohn_: i will do so :)
2013-08-11 13:53:07	mischief	haha really?
2013-08-11 13:53:17	+skelterjohn_	moraes: it guesses everything that you could want to do, and does it for you according to a bunch of conventions
2013-08-11 13:53:24	xtg	skelterjohn: "it'd save less time" -- that seems unintuitive
2013-08-11 13:53:27	+skelterjohn_	if there is something you want to do that it didn't guess, you basically can't do it
2013-08-11 13:54:09	xtg	skelterjohn: save less time compared to what (if you're using the current gopp implementation as a baseline, then it can't save time compared to itself)
2013-08-11 13:54:10	+skelterjohn_	xtg: parsing is, i think, exponential time, and decoding is linear
2013-08-11 13:54:16	moraes	guys, i didn't like revel when i looked at it, but if it is popular on github people like it
2013-08-11 13:54:22	+skelterjohn_	we could trim that last linear bit off, but it wouldn't make a huge dent
2013-08-11 13:54:31	+skelterjohn_	that's what skipping the intermediate bit would add
2013-08-11 13:54:31	moraes	like people like webpy in python despite that it sucks
2013-08-11 13:54:33	moraes	:P
2013-08-11 13:54:52	dominikh	getting so drunk that you vomit is very popular with certain groups of people, too. doesn't mean it's a good idea or that it should be recommended to anyone who is asking how to have a fun time on his weekend.
2013-08-11 13:55:02	xtg	btw, moraes: have you considered something analogous to json.Unmarshaler for gorilla's schema package?
2013-08-11 13:55:15	+skelterjohn_	xtg: actually, i'm not using the right factors. decoding isn't linear with input size, it's linear with the resulting go object's size, which is the same order as the AST's size

2013-08-11 13:55:35	moraes	i don't like schema very much
2013-08-11 13:56:09	+skelterjohn_	but creating the AST is bigger than O(n), since there could be many rules you try to match that fail
2013-08-11 13:56:09	xtg	moraes: exposing reflect.Type in the API (along with custom converter registration stuff) takes a lot more code to work with than something like json's approach
2013-08-11 13:56:09	+skelterjohn_	i should sit down and figure out exactly what those factors are
2013-08-11 13:56:49	xtg	skelterjohn: the deal with skipping the middleman is that you never have to build an ast -- you just fill the app specified one
2013-08-11 13:56:57	bcows	what is the simplest/shortest way to create a list of unique int tuples in go? in a language that had generics it would be something like list<tuple<int,int>>().addIfNotExists(someTuple) .... I guess in go you have to explcitly declare a struct with 2 int fields or is there a better way to do it?
2013-08-11 13:57:09	+skelterjohn_	xtg: right, and i'm saying that not building that AST won't save much :)
2013-08-11 13:57:11	+skelterjohn_	compared to the overall cost of what you're doing
2013-08-11 13:57:13	xtg	skelterjohn: huh
2013-08-11 13:57:43	xtg	skelterjohn: i feel like tokenization + decoding should be overall worst case linear
2013-08-11 13:57:48	+skelterjohn_	the memory used by the AST is O(the memory used by the decoded object)

2013-08-11 13:58:54	moraes	xtg, true
2013-08-11 13:58:57	+skelterjohn_	the time to build the AST is not linear with the number of tokens, though
2013-08-11 13:59:03	+skelterjohn_	i believe it's an exponential
2013-08-11 13:59:10	bcows	ah thx mcef
2013-08-11 13:59:30	moraes	xtg, schema could probably be simplified to work like that
2013-08-11 13:59:42	+skelterjohn_	some exponential involving the number of tokens and the size of the grammar

2013-08-11 15:47:29	zephyrtronium	skelterjohn_: would you agree that creating a gopp grammar is a bottom-up process?
2013-08-11 15:47:44	zephyrtronium	because i am trying to do it top-down and i feel like this is not working
2013-08-11 15:48:29	Tv`	zephyrtronium: that sounds like just generic programming top-down vs bottom-up; it's hard to top-down into unfamiliar tools

2013-08-11 15:48:44	Tv`	and my preferred approach is both; bottom-up building blocks and top-down how they interconnect
2013-08-11 15:48:47	zephyrtronium	top-down just makes more sense to me when it comes to specifying grammars

2013-08-11 15:49:13	Tv`	yeah just saying if gopp is unfamiliar to you, bottom-up gives you concrete challenges to learn with
2013-08-11 15:49:32	dbudworth	looks like you can't do func == func comparisons, so how would you normally do things like listener callbacks where you can add/remove callbacks?  without == on funcs, the remove is a bit difficult

2013-08-11 15:49:51	zephyrtronium	an expression is a unary expression or a binary expression or a literal; a unary expression is a + followed by an expression or a - followed by an expression or...
2013-08-11 15:49:59	Tv`	dbudworth: http://golang.org/ref/spec#Comparison_operators -- funcs are not comparable, except to nil

2013-08-11 15:50:32	dbudworth	Tv`: right, just found that out... so how do people do things like register a list of callbacks for something, (ie: change listener)
2013-08-11 15:50:32	Tv`	dbudworth: listener callbacks are not idiomatic Go anyway, maybe you wanted a channel?
2013-08-11 15:50:44	dominikh	makes me wonder why func == wasn't defined as pointer comparison though
2013-08-11 15:50:49	Tv`	dominikh: optimization?
2013-08-11 15:50:57	dominikh	Tv`: I... am not sure what that optimizes.
2013-08-11 15:50:59	mcef	How would you compare closures?
2013-08-11 15:50:59	Tv`	i can easily imagine specialized variants of function or such
2013-08-11 15:51:03	Tv`	dominikh: futureproofing
2013-08-11 15:51:24	dominikh	hm, yeah
2013-08-11 15:51:44	xtg	Tv`: listener callbacks are often idiomatic -- that's what net/http does
2013-08-11 15:51:44	dbudworth	Tv`: yeah, was thinking a channel, but I didn't want to impose using channels on my client... ie: if all I want to do is fmt.Println(event), i'd have to kick of a goroutine so I can have a channel so i can get the event to print
2013-08-11 15:51:47	Tv`	dbudworth: e.g. https://github.com/tv42/topic or take an interface instead of a func
2013-08-11 15:51:52	mcef	net/http doesn't have any way to remove functions.
2013-08-11 15:51:55	dominikh	by the way Tv`, http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=6042 see Symond's proposed solution

2013-08-11 15:52:08	mcef	Though, if it did, you'd remove them by path.
2013-08-11 15:52:14	xtg	mcef: that can be worked around
2013-08-11 15:52:41	Tv`	dominikh: we talked about that; that'll screw up anyone who manually ran git checkout the_specific_thing_i_want
2013-08-11 15:52:59	Tv`	dominikh: then again, maybe go get -u should; dunno
2013-08-11 15:53:00	dominikh	Tv`: you really shouldn't use go get then
2013-08-11 15:53:03	xtg	mcef: and http.Handle and HandleFunc are convenience funcs -- you can always pass an http.Handler to Listen
2013-08-11 15:53:14	mcef	Well, ServeMux pretty much holds a slice of pattern-handler pairs (plus extra stuff).
2013-08-11 15:53:20	Tv`	dominikh: yeah.. all i'm saying is, our earlier conversation covered this ground, and i can't off-hand remember all the arguments
2013-08-11 15:53:29	dominikh	Tv`: but at least it fixes pre 1.2 checkouts
2013-08-11 15:53:44	dominikh	Tv`: the symbolic-ref check is fancy
2013-08-11 15:54:13	Tv`	dominikh: https://botbot.me/freenode/go-nuts/msg/4741938/
2013-08-11 15:54:19	dbudworth	so, if I need add/remove listener style, then it's basically make a struct with a func member so I can implement the remove part... yes?  (aside from using channels as the callback mechanism)
2013-08-11 15:54:51	mcef	xtg: http.Listen doesn't use multiple callbacks.
2013-08-11 15:54:59	mcef	It's ServeMux that handles that.
2013-08-11 15:54:59	dominikh	Tv`: yeah, I remember that. "i don't see a way to rescue old repos without adding a command to check for that" wasn't technically true though

2013-08-11 15:55:29	Tv`	dominikh: well, it's a further bastardization of vcs.go

2013-08-12 11:01:53	zephyrtronium	on one hand, the value= syntax would give errors if someone forgets and tries to store a non-value tag, and it allows for futureproofing
2013-08-12 11:02:09	zephyrtronium	on the other hand, no tag type looks much cleaner

2013-08-12 11:02:28	Kovensky	(at least at compile time)
2013-08-12 11:02:57	zephyrtronium	Kovensky: it is impossible to intern all strings at compile time because there are an infinite number of unique strings
2013-08-12 11:03:23	Kovensky	not *all* strings, but all strings that are static data

2013-08-12 11:03:38	zephyrtronium	right, but not all strings are static data
2013-08-12 11:03:40	Kovensky	e.g. if you have 2 strings with the same value, they're compiled as 2 pointers to the same string in BSS
2013-08-12 11:03:50	Kovensky	(or whatever was the section for static data)
2013-08-12 11:03:51	DisposaBoy	Kovensky, string constance AFAIK, yes. but not strings at runtime - I just did a test and I'm using nearly 200m of duplicate strings - it's easy to handle it myself though
2013-08-12 11:04:19	+skelterjohn	so, when you make a new string, you want to compare its hash against the list of already-known strings?

2013-08-12 15:22:56	twmb	if you write goroutines to abuse concurrent principles, you probably don't need to kill goroutines explicitly
2013-08-12 15:23:03	AeroNotix	you can pair a Goroutine with a channel for a poor man's Actor. Which then the goroutine would select on the channel, waiting for messages/a kill signal

2013-08-12 15:27:02	cronos	it's more like: you never care. if something is failing, goroutine should take care of that itself. if it doesn't, the whole thing crashes
2013-08-12 15:27:03	AeroNotix	have your 'actor' goroutines launch with the signature (Messages chan Message, KillChan chan struct{})
2013-08-12 15:27:05	AeroNotix	or something
2013-08-12 15:27:12	AeroNotix	and you can select on those channels

2013-08-12 19:34:13	yac	I have to copy the whole rpc package so I can change every T to StatefullT and modify the rpc.service

2013-08-12 19:40:15	kc5tja	Maybe alter the rpc package to suit your needs and submit a patch?  I figure if you're going to go through that kind of trouble, you might as well at least try to get your changes into the next release.
2013-08-12 19:40:29	Tv`	yac: entertain for a moment the idea that you didn't understand what i suggested
2013-08-12 19:40:35	Tv`	yac: and that you don't need to change net/rpc at all
2013-08-12 19:41:20	Tv`	yac: now, for each incoming connection, instantiate a new moral equivalent of Arith in the net/rpc example, and register it against a per-connection Server
2013-08-12 19:41:58	Tv`	yac: then serve the connection with that Server

2013-08-12 19:43:01	dbudworth_	Is there a way to use partial matching of structs used as map keys?  i.e.: in java, you'd implement hash code / equals to reference only some of your fields
2013-08-12 19:43:09	yac	Tv`: it doesn't solve my problem at all
2013-08-12 19:43:23	Tv`	dbudworth_: put only the part that matters as the key, rest in the value
2013-08-12 19:43:39	Tv`	yac: how so?
2013-08-12 19:43:55	kc5tja	dbudworth_: Tv` was faster than me.  It's best to define a custom struct containing only your needed fields.  The short answer for your question is no.
2013-08-12 19:43:56	yac	Tv`: how exactly will having more Server instances help me, access a state variable from the rpc method?
2013-08-12 19:44:15	dbudworth_	Tv`, kc5tja: got it, thanks
2013-08-12 19:44:25	Tv`	yac: the rpc methods are now methods on a per-connection object
2013-08-12 19:44:46	yac	the rpc method doesn't have access to neither connection, neither the server
2013-08-12 19:45:18	Tv`	yac: type Arith struct { Conn net.Conn }
2013-08-12 19:45:31	Tv`	yac: a := &Arith{conn}
2013-08-12 19:45:31	Tv`	yac: now register a on a Server
2013-08-12 19:45:47	Tv`	yac: in real life, put something other than Conn there, but that should convince you

2013-08-13 09:41:30	sinni800	as in, it reconnects, etc
2013-08-13 09:41:41	cronos	and what would it do?

2013-08-13 09:48:20	sinni800	oh.
2013-08-13 09:48:38	+skelterjohn	it's not like protobufs, where you have to frame it yourself
2013-08-13 09:48:38	sinni800	i thought id have to wrap the gobs somehow

2013-08-13 09:48:54	+skelterjohn	that 'wrapping' is what i'm calling a frame
2013-08-13 09:49:07	sinni800	so by throwing a gob encoder onto a connection... id basically have all the message passing done?

2013-08-13 09:50:19	sinni800	then its easy
2013-08-13 09:50:38	cronos	heh
2013-08-13 09:50:45	+skelterjohn	networking, at the right abstraction level (which go provides) is pretty easy
2013-08-13 09:50:47	mischief	can i make go tool dist print executed commands?
2013-08-13 09:51:01	sinni800	so to ping the connection..
2013-08-13 09:51:06	sinni800	would i just throw a gob in every minute and see what happens?

2013-08-13 09:52:14	+skelterjohn	so your operation always has to be robust (eg, open a new connection and try again)
2013-08-13 09:52:28	+skelterjohn	since your operation is already robust, the tests aren't super useful
2013-08-13 09:52:31	+skelterjohn	so we just don't do them
2013-08-13 09:53:00	riker2000	How can I reference a slice in a function call where I don't know what lenght it is going to have. Aka let's say I want to execute a command with exec.Command("echo", options[0], options[1]).Output() where options has two items that works fine but what if I don't know the lenght of options which is a string slice how can I send it to the function call?
2013-08-13 09:53:12	sinni800	if a tcp connection is dead.. it will take $keepalive to return an err, if i am not mistaken...?

2013-08-13 21:51:29	jeraimee	Hey all, I'm _sure_ this will be a simple question however - I'm feeling extra dumb tonight. I can't seem to figure out how to instantiate this struct containing another struct correctly (for use with mgo) (line 39) http://play.golang.org/p/4eXvM8xsxb
2013-08-13 21:51:45	dominikh	nitrix: there is no default for gofmt, gofmt doesn't care. gofmt gives you tabs. a tab is a tab. how it is displayed depends on your editor
2013-08-13 21:52:13	dominikh	jeraimee: you've got one set of {} too many.
2013-08-13 21:52:29	dominikh	OuterStruct{val1, InnerStruct{val2, val3}}
2013-08-13 21:52:36	nitrix	My editor expands tabs to spaces, I wondering what's gonna happen.
2013-08-13 21:52:38	nitrix	Oh well.

2013-08-13 21:55:38	dominikh	a) you mean slice b) what's a sub collection c) []Type{val1, val2}

2013-08-13 22:00:30	nitrix	When defining an interface, can you precise the full function signature, such as values without that particular full signature doesn't implement it ?

2013-08-13 22:02:49	TylerB	jeraimee: might be worth just using new() and setting each field separately.
2013-08-13 22:03:15	jeraimee	TylerB: Think so? Might be a little easier to read ... Thanks for the suggestion.
2013-08-13 22:03:31	TylerB	Yep. It'd be easier to read and the errors would be easier to find/work with.
2013-08-13 22:03:42	TylerB	Alternatively, add newlines to your initializer.

2013-08-13 22:22:03	benbangert	and the answer from core Go ppl was, "stick nginx in front of it"
2013-08-13 22:22:10	benbangert	which is a crappy answer
2013-08-13 22:22:10	dominikh	more to the point though, it seems pretty standard to implement that limitting in your own application

2013-08-14 11:29:23	anrope	smw, sorry, response body progress callbacks. So as the response is being written back to the client, there are callbacks that deliver the response body in chunks.
2013-08-14 11:29:53	guelfey	anrope: there's no need for them
2013-08-14 11:29:56	smw	anrope, why not just read?
2013-08-14 11:30:05	guelfey	you can just read from the response body

2013-08-14 11:30:36	smw	anrope, In Go, we use synchronous IO. There is no need for callbacks.
2013-08-14 11:30:38	anrope	I don't always want to wait for the entire response to be downloaded. For instance, if there's a 50mb image, I might want to cut off the connection at 10mb.
2013-08-14 11:30:56	guelfey	anrope: so read only 10mb.
2013-08-14 11:31:03	smw	anrope, then read 10MB and close the resp.Body
2013-08-14 11:31:16	AeroNotix	LimitReader
2013-08-14 11:31:32	smw	anrope, I recommend io.CopyN or io.LimitReader
2013-08-14 11:31:33	anrope	I don't have access to resp.Body until the entire request is completed, so the full 50mb has been read anyways.,

2013-08-14 11:32:44	guelfey	the whole point of this interface is that you don't need to download everything, but can control exactly when / how much of the response body you want to read

2013-08-14 14:53:20	foofoobar	So I'm trying to marshal a struct which has a []byte in it. Is there an easy way to marshal this []byte as a string instead of creating a new struct?

2013-08-15 21:21:18	scottferg	Never seen that before, or a need for it
2013-08-15 21:21:22	Cool_Fire	elasticsearch for sure (that's the one I'm working with now)
2013-08-15 21:21:43	Cool_Fire	Which means probably lucene does too, since elasticsearch is based on that

2013-08-15 21:34:36	Cool_Fire	Something odd is happening with the request body now. The string I'm putting into the io.Reader is "{"from":0, "size":30}" but in wireshark the actual request body is "1\n{\n14\n"from":0, "size":30}\n0"
2013-08-15 21:34:36	jmoiron	but execution time is almost certainly slower to fork/exec qdbus
2013-08-15 21:34:40	Cool_Fire	Still, pretty close :p
2013-08-15 21:35:47	Cool_Fire	the last 0 might be a string terminator or something, but that doesn't quite explain the rest
2013-08-15 21:36:34	zachmassia	Hmm, well in that case, does anyone recommend a dbus lib? There seems to be 2 or 3 different ones (not counting forks)

2013-08-15 21:42:07	raylu	well, suppose i have an interface with a lot of fields. i don't want to pass them all on the stack and would rather pass just a pointer
2013-08-15 21:42:31	dominikh	so pass a pointer to your value. that doesn't mean you have a pointer to an interface, that means you have a pointer IN your interface
2013-08-15 21:42:53	dominikh	fwiw, your os.File from above is actually an *os.File unless you did some funny things.

2013-08-15 23:32:39	Algorithm	Hi, would anyone be able to walk me through some code? I am looking at https://github.com/mrjones/oauth/blob/master/oauth.go. On line 520 the httpExecute method is called. It appears that a http.Header is created and added to the request, but the server I have written sees the header differently. Here's a printout of the header object on the receiving server ("map[User-Agent:[Go 1.1 package http] Referer:[http://localhost:8080/request_token]
2013-08-15 23:32:39	Algorithm	Accept-Encoding:[gzip]]"). It's probably obvious, but how do I access the "Authorization" header variable? Does it have something to do with Accept-Encoding being gzip?

2013-08-16 13:22:13	dsal	I just don't want to log to files.  :)

2013-08-16 13:23:09	Tv`	you *cloud* ship that json via syslog, if you really wanted to ;)
2013-08-16 13:23:18	dsal	syslog as a model makes sense.  Scribe as well.

2013-08-16 13:23:31	Tv`	i'm a huge fan of local buffering
2013-08-16 13:23:32	Tv`	because connectivity isn't
2013-08-16 13:23:32	dsal	Though scribe doesn't seem to actually be usable without a lot of effort.
2013-08-16 13:23:33	dsal	I agree with that.
2013-08-16 13:23:47	Tv`	so i write to files, then shove them over to an archive
2013-08-16 13:24:02	Tv`	last place where i really needed to do that, it was hdfs
2013-08-16 13:24:03	dsal	My stupid mac mini at home drops off the network regularly and I have to ifconfig down/up to get it to wake back up.  I sleep like, 5-10s after that and log it.  I've not seen that log message yet.
2013-08-16 13:24:22	Tv`	but i wasn't going into the realtime aspects back then
2013-08-16 13:24:32	Tv`	more like huge clunky analysis

2013-08-16 13:24:51	rpd	dsal: just add a call to ifconfig in your log code
2013-08-16 13:24:57	rpd	I don't see how that could possibly be a bad idea

2013-08-16 13:25:33	bcows	dsal, rpd: I guess it depends on the domain, I think for doing CRUD operations to a datastore it's possible with generics to write a simpler library and save code, the same concept may not work out as well for systems type programming or other domains though
2013-08-16 13:25:39	Tv`	surely a splendid plan
2013-08-16 13:25:40	dsal	I'm just logging that I had to repair the network.

2013-08-16 13:26:58	rpd	generics are fine for systems programming and other domains
2013-08-16 13:27:13	dsal	There are sort helpers that use reflection that might help if you just want to avoid code.  You have to pay with *something*, though.
2013-08-16 13:28:00	rpd	personally, I'm a C++/python/js programmer
2013-08-16 13:28:05	rpd	and I love my generics
2013-08-16 13:28:23	rpd	but I see the advantages in upkeep maintenance in being extremely explicit

2013-08-16 20:51:45	dominikh	here's an example: I have an import path honnef.co/go/id3; HTTP request to that will get you <meta name="go-import" content="honnef.co/go/id3 git https://github.com/dominikh/go-id3"> – that won't cause any second request since the prefix matches.
2013-08-16 20:51:59	nitrix	Nah it says you're supposed to have <meta name="go-import" content="import-prefix vcs repo-root">.... and then, only if it's there (<meta name="go-import" content="example.org git https://code.org/r/p/exproj">), then it will query the domain root to find the same meta tag

2013-08-16 23:58:10	luke_s	Anyone know how to tell cgo to use relative path to package directory for -L?
2013-08-16 23:58:58	dominikh	pretty sure cgo will just run gcc in the package's directory, so any relative path should work.
2013-08-16 23:59:37	luke_s	For some reason it isn't. If my working directory is in the packages src directory, then it works. But if I'm in my home folder, for example, it doesn't work. -I for header files works correctly though.
2013-08-17 00:00:08	dominikh	both -I and -L get passed to the same program though, don't they
2013-08-17 00:00:10	luke_s	The C/C++ package I'm using I have as a git submodule in my packages src directory, and it compiles the library inside of that directory.

2013-08-17 00:00:35	luke_s	They should. But -I is working, and -L is not, at least if I'm in a directory other than the packages src dir.
2013-08-17 00:00:45	kushal	http://paste.fedoraproject.org/32738/13767120 is crashing with runtime memory error, can anyone have a look ?
2013-08-17 00:00:48	zephyrtronium	did you try -x to see what is actually going on?

2013-08-17 00:03:07	dominikh	not really surprising, is it. for one, the defer in line 12 should come after the error check. second, you should not just print the error and then continue as if it had never happened

2013-08-17 00:03:22	dominikh	there was an error, *stop*. what you're doing is ignoring the fact that redis couldn't connect and then still try to use the connection, which is nil

2013-08-17 00:16:32	luke_s	I use it because I have to. It'll get better with time, I'm sure.
2013-08-17 00:17:47	adu	one posibility would be to compile c with go's calling convention
2013-08-17 00:18:26	adu	the reverse is not possible
2013-08-17 00:18:31	luke_s	Well if there is a way to make cgo better, I'm all for it.
2013-08-17 00:18:56	adu	it would require recompiling the entire OS, which rules out commercial OSs
2013-08-17 00:18:58	dominikh	cgo is only a lubricant. it shouldn't be improved, it should be made unnecessary
2013-08-17 00:19:10	luke_s	Normally I write stuff in Go, but it's quite fruitless to try and make a JavaScript engine when V8 works :).
2013-08-17 00:19:34	smw	dominikh, I don't like such thinking
2013-08-17 00:19:45	smw	dominikh, there are some projects that are just too big to port
2013-08-17 00:19:56	luke_s	Care to rewrite V8's 500,000 lines in Go?
2013-08-17 00:20:07	smw	dominikh, you want to rewrite sqlite in Go. A library with years of battle tested use?
2013-08-17 00:20:08	luke_s	Not sure if it's that many, but I know it's a lot.
2013-08-17 00:20:09	adu	luke_s: I will
2013-08-17 00:20:25	smw	V8 is another example, +1 luke_s
2013-08-17 00:21:07	luke_s	Plus V8 is written in C++ because Go's garbage collector would get in the way.
2013-08-17 00:21:12	luke_s	I mean to say, that it would not be easy to write it in Go.
2013-08-17 00:21:30	smw	dominikh, sometimes, you want to use major libraries which have been perfected over years of use and development
2013-08-17 00:21:46	adu	it would certainly provide a nice alternative to pkg/encoding/json
2013-08-17 00:21:53	adu	which is severly limited
2013-08-17 00:22:22	dominikh	okay, I honestly fail to see why we need *V8* to replace encoding/json
2013-08-17 00:22:31	luke_s	Uh, that's not what I'd use it for.
2013-08-17 00:22:38	luke_s	I use it for a plugin sandbox.
2013-08-17 00:22:54	dominikh	and that's exactly the kind of thing I meant. Improve encoding/json, ffs.
2013-08-17 00:23:00	smw	luke_s, I want to see python as a plugin sandbox personally :-)
2013-08-17 00:23:15	dsal	I just use otto when I want javascript.
2013-08-17 00:23:32	dominikh	Frankly I'm far more excited by the possibility of compiling Go code as shared libraries to embed them in C.
2013-08-17 00:23:49	luke_s	Well I chose JavaScript because everyone knows it, and JavaScript is built to be sandboxed. Other languages not so much. It has been "battle tested" that way.
2013-08-17 00:24:24	dsal	lua is built to be sandboxed.  javascript is built... just because.
2013-08-17 00:24:41	zephyrtronium	i wonder whether it would be possible to do python in go seamlessly
2013-08-17 00:24:43	smw	dsal, lua isn't exactly well known :-)
2013-08-17 00:24:50	dsal	Yeah, that's what I keep hearing.
2013-08-17 00:24:51	luke_s	I may add something like lua later on. Right now, most of our customers know JavaScript.
2013-08-17 00:24:52	adu	lua is pretty sweet, I compiled it for my Android phone in like an hour
2013-08-17 00:25:03	dsal	I think more people know lua than javascript.

2013-08-18 20:52:41	dsal	I'm pretty sure google could just like, turn off all their computers and email queries to rsc
2013-08-18 20:52:49	dominikh	fwiw, I kind of share his point about interface vs struct
2013-08-18 20:53:08	dsal	I don't run into that enough.  Where does it matter?

2013-08-18 20:53:31	dsal	Oh.  I just don't care if I'm getting a value or a reference.
2013-08-18 20:53:51	dsal	I'd rather have more... value in my code.
2013-08-18 20:54:39	dsal	Like the guy earlier who was having fields go nil in his structs.  It didn't seem that passing a pointer to the struct *helped* in any way, but there could be a hidden piece of code eating the value.

2013-08-18 22:12:50	dominikh	there's not really a script-less command to reinstall all installed packages, and it really should handle the version upgrades itself, but you're not the first for whom it failed
2013-08-18 22:12:58	realrocker	nitrix how can I help?
2013-08-18 22:13:27	dominikh	yeah it being recursive will lead to some errors. easiest would be to rm -r $GOPATH/pkg and then go install the stuff you care about and work on...
2013-08-18 22:13:31	nitrix	realrocker: are you here often? Mid-next week I'll start a git and show you what I have in mind.

2013-08-18 23:17:17	motionman	power corrupts
2013-08-18 23:17:28	nitrix	It takes a shitload to run a huge base, just saying.
2013-08-18 23:17:33	MetaCosm	Yes, because amassing wealth and power is the road of nice people.
2013-08-18 23:17:41	nitrix	But you're right, if you do that, you might want to become big as well.
2013-08-18 23:17:47	mortdeus	james4k, Sure, all software has issues and setbacks that could have been avoided early in design. My point was that there is software that mutates into a horrific monstrosity and there is software that evolves into simple elegance. Essentially the software's "genetics" the developer defines at a projects conception hints at  what the software will eventually become.
2013-08-18 23:17:53	dominikh	what's important with new areas and expensive travelling is though that you don't want to prevent new players from eventually reaching old players. otherwise you might just as well have a lot of separate instances
2013-08-18 23:18:19	nitrix	dominikh: what about new players might only face new players?
2013-08-18 23:18:21	dominikh	in EVE, give me a day and ungodly luck and I can reach anyone
2013-08-18 23:18:34	MetaCosm	dictators are more efficient, unless your game world creates MASSIVE disadvantages, groups will be run by dictators for efficiency

2013-08-18 23:19:29	nitrix	dominikh: you could only attack players on your own hidden rank or something... BUT, if you send a ship to trade stuff with someone else, and it's iontercepted by a higher level, well too bad.
2013-08-18 23:19:30	dominikh	yea
2013-08-18 23:19:32	MetaCosm	"with the wind" "against the wind"
2013-08-18 23:19:35	nitrix	something like that?
2013-08-18 23:19:58	dominikh	MetaCosm: wind in outer space might be a difficult concept ;)
2013-08-18 23:20:13	mortdeus	For example, Go was from its conception elegantly designed, and as it grows it becomes more elegant in design. C++ suffered because Bjarne Stoustrup didnt establish a solid C++ design.
2013-08-18 23:20:23	mortdeus	was elegantly designed*
2013-08-18 23:20:37	dominikh	nitrix: maybe. EVE obviously has it easier because you don't have an immobile base, you have a ship. it's easy to jump in and out of more dangerous territory
2013-08-18 23:20:41	MetaCosm	I actually really like the idea of space and unbalanced travel costs separating new people from old... it even somewhat elegantly solves the "friend" problem (newbies can travel to high level friends, but it is a one way trip)

2013-08-19 14:59:03	mortdeus	rajib, I recommend sticking with Go for atleast a few weeks before giving up on it. I passed Go up the first time I glanced over it right when go1.1 came out. It wasnt until I took udacity's web development class taught by steve huffman. He teaches using the python version of app engine and I dont like python (which is one of the reasons I passed Go up. It looked like python/ruby). I noticed the experimental Go version of appengine and decided to give
2013-08-19 14:59:04	mortdeus	the language another Go. Its the only language ive used since.

2013-08-19 16:42:20	kc5tja	On the subject of gofmt -s, what does "simplify code" mean precisely?

2013-08-19 16:44:18	kc5tja	Ahh, I see.
2013-08-19 16:44:48	kc5tja	I usually do that because I can never remember precedence rules vis-a-vis boolean operators.

2013-08-19 20:23:36	zachmassia	So I know that string concat with += is bad, but what about something like `port = ":" + os.Getenv("PORT")`?
2013-08-19 20:23:49	zachmassia	Is that fine, or should I use sprintf?
2013-08-19 20:24:17	shanemhansen	It's highly unlikely there will be a noticeable performance difference zachamassia.

2013-08-19 20:30:04	dsal	If you find a way to break a string, that's a bug.
2013-08-19 20:30:17	dsal	It's very important that you understand why you avoid certain things, though. :)
2013-08-19 20:30:41	zachmassia	Indeed, I must of been tired or something when I looked into that. 
2013-08-19 20:30:43	dsal	There was a lot of lore around avoiding + for string concatenation in java that led to more verbose code that performed worse.
2013-08-19 20:31:03	dsal	There are scenarios where it's quite bad for sure in most languages.
2013-08-19 20:31:59	zachmassia	Never done much Java, so not sure where I got it from. Thanks for the info though guys :)
2013-08-19 20:32:20	dsal	java, javascript, python, go, etc...  It's bad for the same reason in all these languages.
2013-08-19 20:32:40	dsal	But anything related to performance doesn't matter in a one-off.

2013-08-19 20:35:50	dsal	zachmassia: I think you should learn net/http since you have it.  It works pretty great.
2013-08-19 20:36:23	dsal	I've never used Revel.  Perhaps I just don't understand the problems I'm experiencing right now.  I'm OK with that.

2013-08-20 20:53:29	nitrix	dominikh: last concern, would it be possible to write a kernel in Go?

2013-08-20 20:54:12	dominikh	nitrix: the Go runtime itself expects to run on a host system with certain features. there used to be the tiny go runtime to run on bare metal, but that went unmaintained a long time ago
2013-08-20 20:54:21	nitrix	dominikh: Key point being fesability, not simplicity. I'm curious how far someone can bring the language.
2013-08-20 20:54:36	nitrix	dominikh: okay, but say someone doesn't uses OS-specific features?
2013-08-20 20:54:51	dominikh	nitrix: if you manage to rewrite the runtime to work on bare metal, sure. but that's no trivial task, otoh it would be kind of implementing a kernel in the runtime :)

2013-08-20 20:55:08	dominikh	*Go* uses OS-specific features. the scheduler, for example ;)
2013-08-20 20:55:52	nitrix	I see. So Go won't be able to do bare-level.
2013-08-20 20:56:10	nitrix	bare-metal
2013-08-20 20:56:36	dominikh	not unless you replace the runtime, no. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/golang-nuts/tiny/golang-nuts/fzJ35yHvRGE/-a2Mx7f1Ho8J
2013-08-20 20:56:37	+danderso1	the tiny runtime was a proof of concept of that.

2013-08-20 20:56:48	dominikh	that thread discusses "reviving" the tiny runtime, or what would be needed

2013-08-20 20:57:29	foobaz	note that the C runtime doesn't run on bare metal either
2013-08-20 20:58:11	+danderson	it does require less scaffolding though
2013-08-20 20:58:13	nitrix	Yeah that's my idea. Couldn't someone write bare-metal stuff with Go avoiding memory allocations, file i/o, etc ?

2013-08-20 20:58:27	+danderson	(source: I implemented an embedded OS in C, the assembler "runtime" required was maybe 200 instructions)
2013-08-20 20:58:29	dominikh	nitrix: then all you have left is C with a different syntax.

2013-08-20 20:59:15	nitrix	That's correct. Okay, forget this then :P
2013-08-20 20:59:38	+danderson	if you can get to the point where you can run any code specified by the language, but have only the `unsafe` package from the stdlib
2013-08-20 20:59:46	+danderson	I'd consider that a working tiny runtime
2013-08-20 21:00:06	+danderson	most of the rest of the stdlib depends on OS functionality (with exceptions that should compile completely fine)

2013-08-20 21:26:06	dominikh	there's really no such thing as "subpackages". a package is a package and has, on itself, no nesting or hierarchy. only the filesystem in which the package is might have a hierarchy
2013-08-20 21:26:16	ingbiri	Although packages have a hierarchical namespace, there is no hierarchal relationship between packages. Importing http does not import packages from subdirectories because those packages have no special relationship with the parent.

2013-08-20 22:33:43	Tv`	gah i want to read user-input data into a struct, not all values are valid, but returning err from this all the time would get frustrating
2013-08-20 22:33:58	dominikh	what do you mean by all the time?
2013-08-20 22:34:06	Omnikron13	dominikh: Well I feel dumb now... Put everying in go/ instead of go/src/ after the reinstall. >_>
2013-08-20 22:34:13	Tv`	dominikh: imagine reading several megabytes of 64-byte chunks

2013-08-20 22:34:40	Tv`	i think i'll convert invalid input into a distinct invalid value
2013-08-20 22:34:57	dominikh	Tv`: have some type that stores an error, checks if there's an error on read, if yes does nothing. read everything, check stored error?
2013-08-20 22:35:09	dominikh	or is that not an option?
2013-08-20 22:35:24	Tv`	doesn't really fit the design
2013-08-20 22:35:34	dominikh	I don't know your design :(
2013-08-20 22:35:39	Tv`	but i this is why i have reserved values; i'll just declare one of them to be invalid
2013-08-20 22:35:44	dominikh	heh
2013-08-20 22:35:48	Tv`	and if you use the invalid value in apis later, i'll make *them* crap out

2013-08-21 00:44:34	lukeholder	so im interested in doing a screencast series and want to register a domain
2013-08-21 00:44:35	dominikh	posting the link in the Go group on G+ probably gives you enough exposure for a start, anyway
2013-08-21 00:44:55	lukeholder	gocasts.com ?

2013-08-21 00:46:46	dominikh	gocasts.com might be hard/expensive to obtain, seeing that it's a parked domain by buydomains.com who sell "premium domain names"
2013-08-21 00:47:00	lukeholder	yeah they are selling it for 3,400
2013-08-21 00:47:07	dominikh	totally worth it.
2013-08-21 00:47:16	lukeholder	haha
2013-08-21 00:47:16	davecheney	a pox on domain squatters
2013-08-21 00:47:33	lukeholder	goscreencasts.com is taken too
2013-08-21 00:47:35	smw	lukeholder, we are going to continue to recommend Go over Golang. I do however recommend sneaking golang throughout the site. Both hidden and in keywords

2013-08-21 00:48:00	dominikh	personally I would worry about content before domain name
2013-08-21 00:48:40	lukeholder	yeah I know  will be releasing the first 2 soon.. maybe just on youtube and share the link around and get feedback...

2013-08-21 14:21:03	realrocker	aegis__ simply put Go type is not same as Java type or class. In java class!=type, In go struct==type.
2013-08-21 14:21:43	Tv`	"struct==type" sounds weird
2013-08-21 14:22:18	kc5tja	class != type, but struct == type?  That's worse than wrong.
2013-08-21 14:22:59	kc5tja	Mathematically speaking, a type is a constrained set of values, and the set of operations that act upon those values.  That makes a class much more of a 'type' than any struct is.
2013-08-21 14:23:23	kc5tja	But in Go, we have interfaces to support duck-typing, so technically, interfaces come closer still to types.

2013-08-21 20:00:56	danieleB	dsal, ok I see what you mean, the compiler itself tries to optimized memory allocation. But what I would like to understand is if there is a good practise for passing a struct to another function
2013-08-21 20:01:10	Tv`	is there a way to tell gocov that some panics really are never reached?
2013-08-21 20:01:19	dsal	danieleB: No, it *can*.  But you just can't guess at performance.
2013-08-21 20:01:30	dominikh	Tv`: why bother?
2013-08-21 20:01:36	dsal	danieleB: The best practice is to do the thing that does what your program needs and measure.
2013-08-21 20:01:54	dominikh	Tv`: also, just recently I reached a panic in someone's code that should be "never reached" :)

2013-08-21 20:03:18	dsal	dominikh: Somewhere in China, I think.
2013-08-21 20:03:24	Tv`	dominikh: because this library returns err on some invalid inputs, and i'm not giving it invalid input
2013-08-21 20:03:37	dsal	danieleB: As a beginner, you should not worry about those details at all.  :)
2013-08-21 20:04:00	danieleB	dsal, I am a beginner, I am writing a very important code :-)
2013-08-21 20:04:12	dsal	danieleB: Then it's very important you learn how to measure it.
2013-08-21 20:04:18	danieleB	dsal, I am actually porting to GO some old code written in PHP and Python
2013-08-21 20:04:26	dsal	Because I can guarantee if there's something wrong with it, it won't be that bit and you won't expect it.

2013-08-21 21:52:35	davecheney	nitrix: correct
2013-08-21 21:52:51	nitrix	Does that means there's a scheduler in the runtime ?

2013-08-21 21:53:01	james4k	only issue is that im going to have to buffer these when each finalizer is called and actually call GL on the main thread to release them

2013-08-21 21:53:35	nitrix	davecheney: Mhh. So main() is probably a goroutine itself then. Okay so where I'm going is, what's the overhead of creating a go-routine ?
2013-08-21 21:53:48	davecheney	nitrix: the overhead is small
2013-08-21 21:54:02	nitrix	So a typical web server would create a routine for every connections?
2013-08-21 21:54:05	davecheney	4096 bytes of ram and a small amnount of runtime bookkeeping value

2013-08-21 21:54:54	frobnitz	So, I want to know if y holds a value that can be converted to float64.
2013-08-21 21:54:56	davecheney	nitrix: that is what the runtime does under the hood for you

2013-08-21 21:55:44	davecheney	x is a value type, not an interface type

2013-08-21 21:56:12	nitrix	davecheney: if Go made it very simple to do concurrency, I might give it a try. The reason it was in a single thread in C was to avoid the complexity of threaded programming with no noticable gain.
2013-08-21 21:56:16	davecheney	it smells lkike you want a type which is somethig like an abstract number type

2013-08-22 00:50:50	lavos	I find it more about sharing information. Many of my challenged pass pointers, so it's not alocating memory to be sure.
2013-08-22 00:51:21	lavos	I think it's more a thought exercise than a something that should be taken at face value
2013-08-22 00:51:36	lavos	challenged = channels
2013-08-22 00:51:48	lavos	I'm tired. :P
2013-08-22 00:53:08	jmoiron	i just see it quoted a lot
2013-08-22 00:53:25	jmoiron	and i figured that there was something profound about it that I'm missing
2013-08-22 00:53:27	batman____	Am I able to declare types in the var () thingy?
2013-08-22 00:53:37	jmoiron	no declare types with 'type'
2013-08-22 00:54:03	batman____	just outside of any function?
2013-08-22 00:54:03	jmoiron	though you can use structs as throwaway types
2013-08-22 00:54:14	dominikh	jmoiron: the point of it is that instead of having multiple things hold references to memory and "communicate" by locking and manipulating it, you pass around references to things, so that only one has it at a time.
2013-08-22 00:54:48	batman____	ok thx

2013-08-22 02:16:46	dsal	That's an odd question.  It'd imply a bug in the kqueue/epoll/whatever layer.  Do you have reason to suspect this is happening?
2013-08-22 02:17:01	tadh	well i don't know what is happening
2013-08-22 02:17:14	tadh	i have a distributed system with N producers and M consumers
2013-08-22 02:17:20	dsal	Step 1:  Find out what's happening!  :)
2013-08-22 02:17:41	tadh	sometimes a particular consumer will get popular and bog down
2013-08-22 02:17:49	tadh	however, there is still work for the other consumers
2013-08-22 02:18:22	tadh	they however go completely idle while the busy consumer finishes its work
2013-08-22 02:18:43	tadh	the producers have a buffered channel and a goroutine feeding the sockets for each consumer
2013-08-22 02:18:55	tadh	so in theory all consumers should continue to consume

2013-08-22 04:22:50	riker2000	what is the meaning of "_" in this for loop : for _, name := range files {
2013-08-22 04:23:27	leehambley	riker2000: it means swallow the index, range files will return "0, name" -> "1, name", etc
2013-08-22 04:23:50	davecheney	is there anyone from Apcera in the channel ?
2013-08-22 04:23:50	leehambley	and in the line you posted the author isn't interestted in the index, so they're assigning it to _ ( i.e nowhere )
2013-08-22 04:24:12	taruti	leehambley: maybe implement a mock driver for database/sql?
2013-08-22 04:24:28	riker2000	so "_" is somthing like nil or /dev/null

2013-08-22 06:04:24	jessta	the sugar I'd expect from tuple would be pattern matching and indexing.
2013-08-22 06:05:53	moraes	pattern matching?
2013-08-22 06:06:04	jessta	eg. a := struct{int,string}{1,"pizza"}; a[0] == 1; a[1] == "pizza"; i,s := a; i == 1; s == "pizza"
2013-08-22 06:07:24	moraes	that's indexing
2013-08-22 06:07:30	moraes	right?
2013-08-22 06:08:07	jessta	i, s = a; would destructure the tuple in to i and s
2013-08-22 06:08:21	moraes	yes. interesting.
2013-08-22 06:08:29	moraes	go could have that. maybe.
2013-08-22 06:08:38	jessta	but I think it would be rarely used
2013-08-22 06:09:06	jessta	it would largely replace the multiple return values
2013-08-22 06:09:24	jessta	but it would also make for some confusion.

2013-08-22 07:38:51	cronos	and safety
2013-08-22 07:39:16	jessta	lines of code are cheap, simple lines of code are basically free
2013-08-22 07:40:20	jessta	I much prefer 5 lines of code I can pattern match and not read over 1 line of code that I have to stop and unpack.
2013-08-22 07:40:30	arsatiki	oh god
2013-08-22 07:40:34	Phoop	Playing with Go for a few days now, only thing Im struggling with are pointers and when to use them. But I blame that on always developing with high-lvl languages
2013-08-22 07:40:46	arsatiki	having every 1-liner turn into 5-liners is awful
2013-08-22 07:41:05	+skelterjohn	that would be awful if it were every 1-liner
2013-08-22 07:41:11	+skelterjohn	go also has lots of 5-liners turn into 1-liners

2013-08-22 07:41:34	+skelterjohn	or java, if you want a 15-liner to turn into a 1-liner

2013-08-22 07:49:06	Phoop	Can you elaborate the built-in types?
2013-08-22 07:49:31	jessta	int, float63, slice, map, func etc.
2013-08-22 07:49:55	Phoop	int, float64 etc are always pointer or some other reason?
2013-08-22 07:49:55	cronos	interface
2013-08-22 07:49:56	jessta	and interfaces, you don't need pointers to interfaces
2013-08-22 07:50:22	mcef	Actually, in my opinion, you should use a pointer mostly when you want the variable to be modifiable and a value when you want to pass only a copy that the function you call can't modify.
2013-08-22 07:50:48	mcef	For example, even with types like time.Time, values might be preferable to pointers.
2013-08-22 07:51:25	cronos	i agree
2013-08-22 07:51:26	jessta	Phoop: they are really small values, generally simpler and cheaper to just pass them around
2013-08-22 07:51:56	mcef	And you usually don't want them to be modified.
2013-08-22 07:52:03	Phoop	Didnt expected it to be that simple, thanks for the patience!
2013-08-22 07:52:04	mcef	Unless you do, then a *int makes quite a bit of sense.

2013-08-22 13:33:57	schmichael	2 threads executing at the same time on different cpus (or cores) == parallelism (but you can refer to threads as being "concurrent" since they're able to run in parallel)

2013-08-22 13:34:31	luke_s	The reason why I ask is because I'm interfacing with V8 (C++), and it cares.

2013-08-22 13:35:41	@skelterjohn	you don't have to think about scheduling, just concurrency, in the same way that you don't have to think about efficient instruction ordering, just end results
2013-08-22 13:36:05	@skelterjohn	it's moving the abstraction one level up, allowing you to simplify your reasoning (and therefore create more fundamentally complex projects)

2013-08-22 13:36:29	luke_s	Well as long as two go routines both doing work use different threads, I'll be fine.
2013-08-22 13:36:29	luke_s	I'm having to do isolate->Enter() from Go, and I can't do that from the same thread in two Go routines. But I'll be calling isolate->Exit() when the work is done. So I think I should be fine.

2013-08-22 13:36:45	@skelterjohn	luke_s: you'd need to have them each runtime.LockOSThread() to be sure
2013-08-22 13:36:52	@skelterjohn	otherwise, the runtime might use the same thread for both of them
2013-08-22 13:36:52	DMorsing	only think about scheduling if you're some sort of weirdo who get their rocks off on that kind of thing :)

2013-08-22 13:37:12	@skelterjohn	luke_s: a goroutine might even change threads randomly
2013-08-22 13:37:15	schmichael	dominikh: 2 tasks are concurrent if they can be executed independently. 2 tasks are parallel if they are being executed at the same time. therefore any tasks that may execute in parallel are concurrent, but not everything that is concurrent executes in parallel (think GOMAXPROCS=1 or dynamic langauges with a global lock)
2013-08-22 13:37:16	@skelterjohn	you have no guarantees without locking
2013-08-22 13:37:36	@skelterjohn	schmichael: two tasks can be executed at the same time and still be dependent

2013-08-22 13:39:08	@skelterjohn	you don't get process multiplexing
2013-08-22 13:39:18	@skelterjohn	so if your goroutine does IO, no other goroutine can use that thread while it's idle
2013-08-22 13:39:24	luke_s	But if a Go routine is doing "work", I don't get that anyway, correct?

2013-08-22 13:41:50	schmichael	skelterjohn: i guess modern architectures do blur the definition of "dependent" considerably, but i still find a highlevel disction between concurrency and parallelism helpful

2013-08-22 13:42:03	@skelterjohn	schmichael: oh certainly, they're different
2013-08-22 13:42:14	schmichael	especially when talking to people from languages like node.js or python which can be concurrent but not parallel
2013-08-22 13:42:14	@skelterjohn	schmichael: but parallelism does not necessarily mean concurrency :)

2013-08-22 13:43:58	@skelterjohn	anything where you ever need same-thread-guarantees must be done via those two runtime functions
2013-08-22 13:44:18	luke_s	You can have multiple threads operate on the same Isolate, but (from what I understand) you can't have one thread operate on multiple Isolates because of the Enter(), Exit() thing.
2013-08-22 13:44:31	@skelterjohn	and different-thread guarantees need those two goroutines to be locked at the same time (which will cause them to be in different threads)

2013-08-22 13:47:08	@skelterjohn	have that goroutine locked

2013-08-22 13:54:33	+danderson	I should note: lastpass does offer convenience options that somewhat reduce the security
2013-08-22 13:54:38	+danderson	be aware of what those options do
2013-08-22 13:54:59	+danderson	e.g. one option is to cache the password store to local storage for trusted devices
2013-08-22 13:55:13	+danderson	so you can access your passwords while offline
2013-08-22 13:55:35	+danderson	the catch is that password store requires only your master password to decrypt, any 2-factor options you've activated are irrelevant
2013-08-22 13:56:08	+danderson	well, they're relevant, but only to sign into the lastpass servers to receive sync updates and such
2013-08-22 13:56:15	+danderson	the local store is 1-factor.

2013-08-22 21:02:41	realrocker	nitrix: another benefit is that most often render thread does the heaviest loading so we keep that separate and loop through it according to the current performance of the game
2013-08-22 21:03:53	nitrix	realrocker: but I've done exactly this without (or maybe unconcisously) but without your design pattern.
2013-08-22 21:03:55	varialus	foobaz: Thanks, I'm sure the guy who submitted the patch knows, but I'm sure I'll also know by the time he gets an email and replies, so I'd rather not bother him with the question.
2013-08-22 21:04:01	realrocker	nitrix: now we can split game thread into other two more threads: one which updates the game logic, another which reads files, resources etc. but that is to be avoided as far as possible

2013-08-22 21:08:47	kbs	speaking of crazy channels :-) if anyone is curious - dmitry offers the thought that the random scheduler issues I was going on about yesterday isn't a real issue in real code - http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=6205 ah well :-)

2013-08-22 21:11:16	realrocker	nitrix: in any case if we use opengl we are going to need a dedicated thread anyway. no point in putting the game logic in there too
2013-08-22 21:11:29	nitrix	oh that's for sure.
2013-08-22 21:11:43	realrocker	i don't see a way around it actually

2013-08-22 21:13:36	nitrix	It happens a lot more than you think, and you don't re-use that many code.

2013-08-22 21:14:05	nitrix	I think the common pitfall of OOP is people building stuff so that they can "reuse them", which fairly never happens like that.
2013-08-22 21:14:07	realrocker	so in component system I will create an AIComponent having multiple ai behavior
2013-08-22 21:14:13	nitrix	It's as bad a premature optimizations.

2013-08-22 21:15:44	varialus	foobaz, it looks like git and mercurial both handle that kind of patch file, but apparently the patch program doesn't, which seems weird, but whatever. I'm just going to use git to do it.
2013-08-22 21:15:55	realrocker	if it looks good then opengl
2013-08-22 21:16:17	nitrix	realrocker: because I have a project on my own, but no knowledge of how opengl works.

2013-08-22 21:23:22	foobaz	you will also need a context creation library, opengl alone is not enough to get something up on the screen

2013-08-22 21:24:30	jessta	kbs: fair scheduling in relation to channel usage sounds very complicated.
2013-08-22 21:24:35	foobaz	i recommend glfw for context creation
2013-08-22 21:24:38	--	marvin is now known as Guest89565
2013-08-22 21:24:53	foobaz	hey yea that looks nice
2013-08-22 21:25:37	foobaz	glfw also functions as a loading library, opengl functions are not straight C functions like in other APIs, different functions are loaded depending on what opengl version and extensions you request
2013-08-22 21:25:47	foobaz	i think it might use glew for that
2013-08-22 21:26:04	kbs	jessta: indeed - but that also seems to be dmitry's stated objective

2013-08-22 21:27:36	realrocker	i have worked with opengl in c, python and java, it must be working the same way right: get the window, create the surface and context, draw
2013-08-22 21:27:46	foobaz	yep, glfw is a popular C api, there are bindings for many languages
2013-08-22 21:28:19	realrocker	never used glfw. only programmed for android
2013-08-22 21:28:50	foobaz	what are you writing? have you considered the impact of the GC?
2013-08-22 21:29:18	danieleB	can you return the whole function from within a goroutine function?
2013-08-22 21:29:30	foobaz	go is not really designed for realtime, the GC introduces pauses, it may not be appropriate for something like an FPS
2013-08-22 21:29:57	realrocker	foobaz: i am not even close to implementing opengl rendering...i was only testing the entity component system in Go
2013-08-22 21:30:36	realrocker	foobaz: shouldn't be a problem for 2d scrollers, Java and python have the same problems, they do fine enough

2013-08-22 21:33:01	foobaz	try to keep allocations and memory consumption to a minimum, allocations affect the number of pauses, and total memory consumption affects the length of each pause
2013-08-22 21:33:02	kbs	jessta: hm. I know skelterjohn said the same thing, and I'm fear I'm missing something subtle both of you are saying. All I need to know, is that the probability of being scheduled is 50% -- I'm not asking for guaranteed scheduling; just that it's increasingly unlikely that I'll never be scheduled
2013-08-22 21:33:02	jessta	kbs: you'd need to record the past history of every goroutine's interaction with every channel it can interact with.

2013-08-22 21:35:27	jessta	kbs: the channel gets filled by writer1 which then blocks, writer2 and writer3 get scheduled and immediately block, and channel gets emptied and then it's fair to schedule writer1 again.

From my naive perspective, I would have thought writer2/3 would scheduled next, since they are certainly waiting as well. But in a larger sense, it's surprising behaviour for me as a coder -- and my fear is that in a more complex set of interactions, I have to reason that one of my goroutines might never be called

2013-08-22 22:40:41	dsal	Or just read the "go help list" docs.  It explains that pretty clearly.

2013-08-23 12:16:47	kbs	I'm trying to wean myself away from Java; partly because the runtime is getting more and more bloated, and harder to manage effectively [for a desktop app]

2013-08-23 12:17:10	pmezard	DisposaBoy: deployment constraints for instance. Tiny go utilities are easier to deploy than python scripts, at least in some environments.

2013-08-23 12:29:22	DisposaBoy	pmezard, perhaps it helps to think of maps,slices as any other object that references underlying data. e.g. a struct that has a pointer field. if you copy the struct you definitely get a copy, but the new copy still shares data with the old one

2013-08-23 12:39:11	smw	darkgray, using = is local with reference types. Anything else is global

2013-08-23 12:39:36	smw	darkgray, there is a reason append is done as x = append(x, y)
2013-08-23 12:39:59	smw	darkgray, it is giving you a clear warning the change is local

2013-08-23 12:40:15	smw	darkgray, x[1] = 2 isn't a direct assignment to x, so it is global
2013-08-23 12:40:41	smw	darkgray, same with maps: x[a] = 3
2013-08-23 12:40:48	smw	and channels: x <- y

2013-08-23 12:56:26	smw	mcef, especially if ssl is involved
2013-08-23 12:56:33	mcef	Keep-alive also means tons of open connections.
2013-08-23 12:56:49	smw	mcef, yes, that is why you need sane timeouts on keep-alive
2013-08-23 12:56:49	mcef	For example, something like a CDN might get only one request per connection.

2013-08-23 12:57:21	mcef	And don't get me started on proxies that persist connections over requests that aren't meant for the same target.
2013-08-23 12:57:30	smw	mcef, yes, but leaving the connection open for a couple seconds after the last request won't hurt.
2013-08-23 12:57:31	gigaroby	since this is all going behind a load balancer
2013-08-23 12:57:48	smw	gigaroby, is it a load balancer that understands http

2013-08-23 12:58:01	gigaroby	I think I can configure it so that it enstablishes only http without keep-alive
2013-08-23 12:58:08	mcef	smw: If each client loads 10 images concurrently (10 requests in 10 connections), then these 10 connections per client will stay open a few seconds after the client is done.
2013-08-23 12:58:27	mcef	Do that with a lot of clients and the number of open connections will be tenfold of a non-keepalive server.
2013-08-23 12:58:39	gigaroby	smw: it's route53, I gotta check
2013-08-23 12:58:45	smw	mcef, unless the server is smart enough to know not to do that
2013-08-23 12:58:47	kc5tja	Just to add to the keep-alive thing (dead horse, I know): TCP's three-way handshake combined with the slow-start algorithm it uses for each new connection means you'll average about 33% to 50% throughput if you just start a new connection every time.  Even without congestion and multiple hops, you're taking a massive performance hit.  :)
2013-08-23 12:58:51	smw	gigaroby, route53 is not a proxy

2013-08-23 13:01:16	mcef	If that really has such big impact, is keepalive really something to be done in each application layer protocol instead of on a lower level for all connections?

2013-08-23 13:05:04	smw	mcef, it is cheaper to keep the connection alive. And you need to look at frontend vs backend
2013-08-23 13:05:11	smw	mcef, on the backend, keepalive is a must
2013-08-23 13:05:49	smw	mcef, since it is relatively few servers sending tons of requests (at the request of users)

2013-08-23 21:21:38	dominikh	and I'd probably return io.EOF instead of a bool, but I'm not sure how out of place EOF is for something that isn't backed by an io.Reader
2013-08-23 21:21:59	dominikh	well, it would simplify Next(), that's all. plain increment instead of the utf8 package
2013-08-23 21:22:33	dominikh	(probably cheaper, too, but I doubt that's a concern for parsing pq options)
2013-08-23 21:22:36	kisielk	well, it's only used in that one function
2013-08-23 21:22:40	kisielk	so I think bool is fine

2013-08-23 21:40:42	dominikh	I just don't push master unless I am 105% sure ;)

2013-08-23 22:02:46	kuroneko	aprt from the fact you can use typical unix permissions to protect them, you can also get the uid/gid of the other process

2013-08-23 22:30:13	+skelterjohn	i was under the impression that there were two mangas too
2013-08-23 22:30:20	dsal	dominikh: I fell asleep in the floor, otherwise I would've told you it would work without you having to do it first.
2013-08-23 22:30:26	jordanorelli	then the manga finished, and they made brotherhood, which is meant to be faithful to the manga.
2013-08-23 22:30:30	dominikh	dsal: hehe. but yeah, this is amazing
2013-08-23 22:30:36	jordanorelli	it's a completely separate story arc.  dante isn't in brotherhood, for example.
2013-08-23 22:30:39	dominikh	it just, like, works
2013-08-23 22:30:47	darkgray	jordanorelli: You know the author's new manga was turned into an anime this season?
2013-08-23 22:30:47	jordanorelli	the homunculus exist for totally different reasons
2013-08-23 22:31:02	jordanorelli	darkgray: no i haven't really been watching anime recently, what's the current one?
2013-08-23 22:31:02	jordanorelli	for that author, that is.

2013-08-23 23:07:09	dsal	So then I want to turn off timestamps because I get two timestamps.

2013-08-23 23:10:11	dsal	You want to do that in a library?
2013-08-23 23:10:25	+skelterjohn	normal errors pertain to bad program input
2013-08-23 23:10:25	+skelterjohn	so your error really needs to talk about the problem with the input
2013-08-23 23:10:31	+skelterjohn	programming errors should just be panics
2013-08-23 23:10:35	dsal	It's doubly weird if I use your library and it gives me error messages describing parts of your code I don't care about.
2013-08-23 23:10:40	+skelterjohn	so that the dev can see exactly where the problem is
2013-08-23 23:11:29	grg	errors can get passed up many levels and knowing exactly where the error occurs is always useful to me
2013-08-23 23:11:33	dsal	Yeah, the panic tells me where in my code I made your code mad.

2013-08-23 23:12:46	+skelterjohn	library used improperly, etc
2013-08-23 23:12:54	dsal	Makes sense in an application, but I don't think it makes sense in a library you want someone else using.  My users seeing your function names and line numbers won't help me fix problems in my program that uses your library.
2013-08-23 23:13:29	grg	ok, well you've given me my options and told me not to do it. So I guess I'll not do it for a while, and if my life is made more difficult I'll ignore the advice at that point.
2013-08-23 23:13:32	grg	Thanks folks.

2013-08-23 23:15:30	grg	but i'd like to point out that existing go packages already do this... e.g. binary.Write() gave me an error with "binary.Write: invalid type bool"

2013-08-23 23:18:28	dsal	I've got one piece of code somewhere that does.  I'm not sure if I can remember where it was, but it's got something to do with asking for a zero-sized something or something nonsense like that.
2013-08-23 23:18:32	+skelterjohn	for instance, if someone tries to multiple a *matrix by a nil pointer

2013-08-23 23:19:29	+skelterjohn	and the programmer needs to be told how it got to that point
2013-08-23 23:19:46	dsal	moraes: In my case, it was something like NewThingy(dims) // if dims made no sense at all, it'd be wrong.  I'd have to add an error return *just in case* the developer asked for something absurd

2013-08-23 23:39:03	grg	Its hard to strike a balance between panic and returning error. What do I do when my app talking to a foreign server receives an unexpected response, based upon data that a user of my library has sent to the server.

2013-08-24 14:21:30	danieleB	?
2013-08-24 14:21:42	mortdeus	It depends.
2013-08-24 14:22:05	danieleB	what is the meaning of this? header := &http.Header{};
2013-08-24 14:22:34	danieleB	create a pointer to a new struct?
2013-08-24 14:22:38	mischief	yes
2013-08-24 14:22:43	mischief	pointer to struct literal
2013-08-24 14:22:45	vsmatck	Double check what Header is.

2013-08-24 14:24:19	mischief	the documents usually clarify quite well
2013-08-24 14:24:38	mortdeus	If you have a struct with fields of pointers, when ever you want to insure the struct's fields are explicitly assigned.

2013-08-24 14:24:57	mortdeus	fail sentence
2013-08-24 14:25:06	vsmatck	You guys may be going on the wrong course since http.Header is a map.
2013-08-24 14:25:32	mischief	so?
2013-08-24 14:25:58	danieleB	vsmatck, actually you are right!
2013-08-24 14:26:04	danieleB	it's a map!
2013-08-24 14:26:29	▬▬▶	Rolken (~Rolken@50.56.207.206) has joined #go-nuts
2013-08-24 14:26:30	danieleB	so it is a pointer, right?
2013-08-24 14:26:46	vsmatck	Not quite. The go map is a reference type.
2013-08-24 14:26:57	mortdeus	danieleB, headers := &http.Header{} is semantically the same as calling headers := new(http.Header). If http.Header is a map, then its a pointer to a 'nil'd map. Which still needs to have 'make' called on it.
2013-08-24 14:27:03	vsmatck	You can make a pointer to it, but for the map it isn't necessary.
2013-08-24 14:27:28	danieleB	what is a reference type?
2013-08-24 14:27:39	mortdeus	a map is a reference type so its already a pointer.
2013-08-24 14:27:58	mischief	you can do h := http.Header{"Content-Type": "text/plain"} no?

2013-08-24 14:28:20	vsmatck	negative, the value of the map is a slice.
2013-08-24 14:28:37	mortdeus	danieleB, a reference type in Go is a special pointer type that has underlying data managed by the runtime.
2013-08-24 14:29:14	danieleB	mischief, type Header map[string][]string

2013-08-24 14:30:45	vsmatck	I usually do something like "h := make(http.Header); h.Add("Content-Type", "application/octet-stream")". You can declare it all in one initialization but I think it looks more clear not to.

2013-08-24 14:43:19	zephyrtronium	which means that making an http.Header is the same as making a map

2013-08-24 14:44:51	mortdeus	danieleB, You call make on reference types in go because the underlying runtime representations of the type are pointers to data. h := &http.Header{} creates a map that has an uninitalized pointer. Which is why its called a nil map.
2013-08-24 14:45:11	danieleB	zephyrtronium, so in case of a map "h := make(http.Header)" is equalivalent to "h := http.Header{}"

2013-08-24 14:47:15	mortdeus	thats why make is called. It instructs the runtime to initalize the pointer to point at valid data.
2013-08-24 14:47:38	mortdeus	danieleB, Right, if you take away the & you still have a nil map.

2013-08-24 14:49:29	mortdeus	the headers := &http.Header{} creates a pointer to a nil map. headers := http.Header{} is a direct handle for the map. But remember the map type itself is a reference type that has a underlying pointer to data only visible to the runtime.

2013-08-24 14:54:29	mcef	`foo := &http.Header{}` is the same as `foo := new(http.Header); *foo = make(http.Header)`
2013-08-24 14:54:49	mcef	new(T) creates a pointer to a T, allocating that space.
2013-08-24 14:55:10	mcef	make(T) where T is a reference type (e.g. map) initializes that, so if T is map, `make(T)` is the same as `T{}`.
2013-08-24 14:55:45	mcef	&T{} initalizes it, then gives you a pointer to that. You usually don't want to do that with a map (it's often done with structs, though.)

2013-08-24 14:56:17	danieleB	isn't make enough?
2013-08-24 14:56:28	mcef	No.
2013-08-24 14:56:32	mcef	new is for pointers
2013-08-24 14:56:37	mcef	make is to initialize reference types
2013-08-24 14:56:47	mcef	So, if you want a *int, you would do foo := new(int)
2013-08-24 14:57:01	mcef	They do completely different job.

2013-08-24 14:59:40	danieleB	if it was a struct, it would be true

2013-08-24 14:59:53	--	fatih|away is now known as fatih
2013-08-24 14:59:55	mcef	But you can't make() a struct.
2013-08-24 15:00:03	mcef	new(T) creates a new zero-value T.
2013-08-24 15:00:09	mcef	A pointer to it, actually.
2013-08-24 15:00:21	mcef	And a zero-value map is a nil map, while there is no such thing as nil struct.
2013-08-24 15:01:24	mcef	So, imagine you have a function `func InitMyStruct() MyStruct` that returns a struct with certain fields set to non-zero default values.
2013-08-24 15:02:05	mcef	Then, `foo := new(MyStruct); *foo = InitMyStruct()` is for the same purpose as `foo := new(map[foo]bar); *foo = make(map[foo]bar)`.

2013-08-24 15:13:27	mortdeus	danieleB, Pretty much. make() is useful when you want to explicitly preallocate a buffer of memory to avoid runtime routines that grow slices and maps. Also for channels make allows you to specify whether or not a channel is buffered. http://golang.org/ref/spec#Making_slices_maps_and_channels
2013-08-24 15:15:15	eXeC64	I don't suppose any of Go's built-in libraries allow you to take a io.Reader that's got a reply from an http server, and parse the header, before deciding what to do with the data? It all seems to be focused on serving responses, not parsing.

2013-08-24 16:54:24	mortdeus	Im thinking that changing it would conflict with the cross platform building capabilities of the compiler. Considering that the best option for plan9 might be to modify the build setup to assume its in a plan9 environment.
2013-08-24 16:55:18	danieleB	it looks like it happens all inside the transport, and it's not possible to access that information from outside

2013-08-25 20:14:42	james4k	depends on what kind of code you're testing
2013-08-25 20:15:00	nitrix	No need for thousand of options, just a clear waterfall and the possibility to have scripts.

2013-08-25 20:16:09	smw	nitrix, just to be sure, you can always have a jenkins job or something follow that tag

2013-08-25 20:16:29	dsal	andrewvos:I used to use assert in these tests. Now they're shorter and easier to manage: https://github.com/dustin/go-humanize/blob/master/bytes_test.go
2013-08-25 20:16:50	smw	nitrix, in that case, you would need to publish to another branch and have your CI do merges
2013-08-25 20:17:03	smw	nitrix, or make git precommit hooks... those are good too
2013-08-25 20:17:31	james4k	nice, dsal

2013-08-25 20:17:54	andrewvos	dsal: It's only less cause you're using a loop
2013-08-25 20:18:10	dsal	It's only less because I do less?

2013-08-25 20:24:43	dsal	I guess it's similar at best with this exact set of tests.  I'll dig out another one.
2013-08-25 20:25:59	Tv`	my biggest reason to dis table driven tests is that i often find i want to pick which specific test to run, and table tests ruin -test.run=
2013-08-25 20:27:11	+skelterjohn	Tv`: I think testing could be extended in a way to let you do that with tables.
2013-08-25 20:27:38	dsal	andrewvos: I have cases like this where there's a lot of code between an input and one or more assertions:  https://github.com/dustin/go-jsonpointer/blob/master/pointer_test.go#L115
2013-08-25 20:27:40	Tv`	skelterjohn: turing machines always "could be"

2013-08-25 20:28:49	andrewvos	dsal: I see
2013-08-25 20:28:49	dsal	All you have to do is add a -table.run flag or something and evaluate each of your inputs against it in your particular test.
2013-08-25 20:28:49	dsal	Most of these run so fast it doesn't matter.

2013-08-25 20:29:09	Tv`	skelterjohn: nose and py.test do this with generators, giving named items, and those show up as "sub items" of the tests, for filtering what to run
2013-08-25 20:29:18	Tv`	skelterjohn: func GenerateXxx(t *testing.T) { ...? }
2013-08-25 20:29:29	andrewvos	Meh this all seems like stuff I don't want to have to use
2013-08-25 20:29:38	andrewvos	I mean, I like the way you wrote that dsal
2013-08-25 20:29:40	Tv`	where it's essentially pairs of name, func (t *testing.T)
2013-08-25 20:29:49	dsal	andrewvos: That's what everybody says when they first start doing testing.
2013-08-25 20:29:50	andrewvos	But yeah I normally don't need that stuff
2013-08-25 20:30:11	andrewvos	dsal: Well I don't mean testing in particular, I mean testing a large table of things

2013-08-25 20:30:24	dsal	When do you not?
2013-08-25 20:30:25	Tv`	andrewvos: testing is important enough that i'd rather have good unit test stuff than a good debugger
2013-08-25 20:30:27	andrewvos	But what I do often to is check that a value is what I want
2013-08-25 20:30:28	dsal	And why does it have to be large?
2013-08-25 20:30:48	dsal	if your function can only work on a single input, then why not just define it as a constant?
2013-08-25 20:30:55	andrewvos	Tv`: I know, testing is important. What I'm arguing against is having three lines of code for every assertion
2013-08-25 20:31:09	andrewvos	Tv`: It quickly becomes unwieldy
2013-08-25 20:31:22	dsal	You can write your own assert pretty quickly.  Here I have tables and asserts:  https://github.com/dustin/go-aprs/blob/master/aprs_test.go#L131
2013-08-25 20:31:38	dsal	People have assert libraries.  I just don't find that they get me very much further along.

2013-08-25 20:32:29	andrewvos	Well if your answer is "write your own assert method", then I can get behind that

2013-08-25 20:32:39	vsmatck	It seems better to not have t.Fatal while iterating through table tests.

2013-08-25 20:33:17	andrewvos	What I do miss, in ruby I can do something like `object.something.should == "blah"`, and then I get a great error like "expected object.something to be "blah"

2013-08-25 20:34:05	andrewvos	dsal: Well it does slow me down I think, when I have so much test code that it becomes a pain to quickly refacotr.

2013-08-25 20:46:16	dsal	OK.  I still assert that if you're doing it right, that's not the biggest part of your tests.  If you find yourself with a list of asserts when you could've done something like this, I think you might just be making things harder on yourself: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/clog/blob/master/clog_test.go#L12

2013-08-25 20:54:52	dsal	If it's for CI, I'd think you'd rather use "go test"
2013-08-25 20:55:01	dsal	And "go vet"
2013-08-25 20:55:02	nitrix	Since the folder containing the code for the executable contains the same name as the executable generated, the thing doesnt work
2013-08-25 20:55:17	nitrix	I suppose i have to run that command outside my project folder to avoid collision
2013-08-25 20:55:26	dsal	It doesn't matter where you run it.
2013-08-25 20:55:28	dsal	I'm confused as to what your isuse is.
2013-08-25 20:55:32	dsal	isseus
2013-08-25 20:55:41	nitrix	Okay I solved it.
2013-08-25 20:55:44	dsal	echew
2013-08-25 20:56:24	nitrix	dsal: go build generates executables in the current directory. The problem was the executable having the same name as an existing directory/file.
2013-08-25 20:56:31	nitrix	I simply had top move elsehwere for it to work.

2013-08-25 20:56:46	dsal	go build shouldn't actually generate an executable in that case
2013-08-25 20:57:00	nitrix	why not ?
2013-08-25 20:57:03	dsal	But it sounds like you're doing something slightly weird and figured it out, so it doesn't matter.
2013-08-25 20:57:17	nitrix	They are multiple main packages.
2013-08-25 20:57:33	dsal	When the command line specifies a single main package, build writes the resulting executable to output. Otherwise build compiles the packages but discards the results, serving only as a check that the packages can be built.
2013-08-25 20:57:51	Tv`	*output* ?
2013-08-25 20:57:55	dsal	I pasted that from "go help build"

2013-08-25 20:58:02	Tv`	go build defaults to writing to current dir
2013-08-25 20:58:16	Tv`	dsal: that's with -o output
2013-08-25 20:58:23	dominikh	dsal: sound like inaccurate docs. the distinction is main vs non-main, not single vs many
2013-08-25 20:58:32	Tv`	If not specified, the
2013-08-25 20:58:32	Tv`	output file name depends on the arguments and derives from the name
2013-08-25 20:58:32	Tv`	of the package, such as p.a for package p, unless p is 'main'.

2013-08-25 20:59:27	Tv`	but yes, go build with multiple packages is only a "see if this works" command
2013-08-25 20:59:30	dsal	It doesn't write out the executable if there's more than one
2013-08-25 21:00:00	dsal	Worse, if you have an older build lying around, it doesn't replace it with one made out of your new code.

2013-08-25 21:00:51	dsal	I just tried it in a repo where the toplevel is a main, but it has a tools/extra/stuff thing.  No files were written in the checkout dir
2013-08-25 21:01:34	nitrix	That's corrent.
2013-08-25 21:01:45	nitrix	Correct. It worked for one package, but not for two or more.
2013-08-25 21:02:05	dsal	It's hilarious that you misspelled correct.
2013-08-25 21:02:05	dsal	But yeah, that will cause you confusion one day.
2013-08-25 21:02:07	nitrix	I'm really lacking sleep.
2013-08-25 21:02:15	dsal	I've been terrible at sleeping.
2013-08-25 21:02:26	nitrix	Is it possible to have it output the fileS?
2013-08-25 21:02:29	dsal	I made it a good way through the day before I remembered eating is part of my daily rituals.
2013-08-25 21:02:40	dsal	nitrix: you pretty much want go list | xargs -n 1
2013-08-25 21:02:55	dsal	go list ./... | xargs -n 1 go build
2013-08-25 21:03:20	dsal	With a little fancier go list invocation, you can have it only print out mains

2013-08-25 21:04:05	Tv`	not as much for go build, but a good habit to pick up
2013-08-25 21:04:13	dsal	Whose argument is that?
2013-08-25 21:04:17	nitrix	I ran dsal's command and the files appeared out of nowhere.
2013-08-25 21:04:25	nitrix	What, the, heck.

2013-08-25 22:39:33	dsal	OK.  Well, I think the only thing that doesn't smell right about it is the naming.  If you name it better, it'll work better.

2013-08-30 22:56:00	ztomo	If anyone has the time, what is the difference between the snippets here - http://pastebin.com/wS5neHtN
2013-08-30 22:56:22	ztomo	in terms of why the first one would be preference to the second?
2013-08-30 22:56:38	twmb	pointers are generally smaller than structures
2013-08-30 22:56:41	smw	ztomo, one returns a pointer, the other a vale
2013-08-30 22:56:46	smw	value*
2013-08-30 22:56:48	twmb	also in go, everything copies: so, either you return a copy of a pointer or a copy of a struct

2013-08-30 22:57:21	ztomo	so the second one is probably using more resources?
2013-08-30 22:57:43	ztomo	i think im not understanding why there's a pointer in the type definition for the fucntion on the first one?
2013-08-30 22:57:56	ztomo	oh wait
2013-08-30 22:57:58	smw	ztomo, don't think about resources when you choose pointers
2013-08-30 22:57:59	ztomo	no because its returning a pointer, yeah

2013-08-30 22:58:25	ztomo	smw, whats the motivator then?
2013-08-30 22:59:20	twmb	well 1, you do think about it, but after you're done getting the logic of your program correct (premature optimization is often unnecessary)
2013-08-30 22:59:44	smw	ztomo, how you work with it. If it is something that holds data, make it a value. If it is something that gets modified and you want all modifications to persist, use pointers

2013-08-30 23:00:32	smw	ztomo, for example, a buffer (bytes.Buffer) is modified by called functions all the time. You want changes to persist so you use pointers.
2013-08-30 23:00:52	twmb	and to echo what smw says, pointers allow you modify what the pointer points to, ... lol.

2013-08-30 23:00:59	smw	ztomo, time.Time's are passed to other functions but not really modified, so you don't use pointers
2013-08-30 23:01:09	ztomo	ah, ok. yeah this is me getting up to speed with pointers again i think, been a long time without them
2013-08-30 23:01:10	smw	twmb, exactly :-P

2013-08-30 23:01:38	ztomo	so in those examples instead of passing a copy of the contents, its a pointer to the contents so its working on the original
2013-08-30 23:01:53	smw	correct
2013-08-30 23:02:15	ztomo	thank you for the feedback. sorry to have to hassle people on basics in here!

2013-08-30 23:14:44	sadasant	I have a little question, sorry if it's too noobish
2013-08-30 23:15:04	sadasant	a := []interface{}
2013-08-30 23:15:10	sadasant	needs to be declared with new? no, right?

2013-08-30 23:15:26	foobaz	no, you never need to use new
2013-08-30 23:15:33	smw	that is perfectly valid
2013-08-30 23:15:33	sadasant	like, a := []string{"hello"}, it's actually always a new point in memory
2013-08-30 23:15:49	foobaz	since that is a slice, you could allocate it with make if you want
2013-08-30 23:15:59	sadasant	new, or &type is necessary when you're working with structs, right? but with other types, not really?

2013-08-30 23:16:28	smw	sadasant, new is never required
2013-08-30 23:16:34	sadasant	foobaz: thanks, but that's to define length, or make is used to asign values too? (sorry if too noob)
2013-08-30 23:16:50	foobaz	make is for when you want a slice with several zero-valued elements
2013-08-30 23:17:02	sadasant	smw: How do you copy the pointer of a struct when it's initialized? Like s := MyStructType{}

2013-08-30 23:17:56	smw	sadasant, yes
2013-08-30 23:17:59	foobaz	yes that is the preferred way to do it
2013-08-30 23:18:17	sadasant	smw: thanks, so I do need to use & for struct types, but for slices, not really, right?
2013-08-30 23:18:27	sadasant	foobaz: thanks!
2013-08-30 23:18:35	foobaz	right, slices are already reference types
2013-08-30 23:18:42	sadasant	exactly, thanks
2013-08-30 23:18:44	smw	sadasant, & is only needed if you want a pointer
2013-08-30 23:18:44	foobaz	and you don't always need to use & for struct types
2013-08-30 23:19:08	sadasant	foobaz: not always, just to make a new pointer to a struct type, no?
2013-08-30 23:19:14	foobaz	yes
2013-08-30 23:19:53	sadasant	Well, I think that was it
2013-08-30 23:19:55	sadasant	thank you very much!

2013-09-02 20:49:06	oakaz	users send server message, server pushes message to users
2013-09-02 20:49:44	oakaz	quite simple idea... or I'm open to simpler ways to practice channels before building things with them

2013-09-02 20:49:53	domevna	oakaz, that's a common pattern.
2013-09-02 20:50:25	twmb	an intro exercise would be to implement a recursive mergesort with channels
2013-09-02 20:50:51	oakaz	why don't we write a while loop in this example: http://tour.golang.org/#65

2013-09-02 20:52:02	domevna	I am guessing that author thought that the example is clearer with duplicated code instead of a loop.

2013-09-03 20:51:22	Nedlinpopo	go get github.com/yourproject/... still only gets the dependencies for that exact package.  I wasn hoping for a way to do it for *all* packages in my $GOPATH/src
2013-09-03 20:51:37	+Namegduf	For those *packages*.
2013-09-03 20:51:48	+Namegduf	It's not a single package just because it's a single repo.
2013-09-03 20:52:04	Nedlinpopo	no, but go get has to be run for each package
2013-09-03 20:52:13	zephyrtronium	that's what ... does
2013-09-03 20:52:13	boj	If you "go get -u" in your project, it will update all the dependencies.
2013-09-03 20:52:18	+Namegduf	Please reread
