2012-11-21 22:36:20	@intothev01d	hello
2012-11-21 22:36:21	krystropolis	whats everyone working on nowadays
2012-11-21 22:37:06	@intothev01d	well recently over in lpmc we've been working on a html5 game for the github game off. also we have other projects ongoing as well
2012-11-21 22:37:33	@intothev01d	https://github.com/LearnProgramming
2012-11-21 22:38:09	krystropolis	yeah i stillhavent put time aside to learn to work github
2012-11-21 22:38:09	krystropolis	that will be happening soon though
2012-11-21 22:39:40	krystropolis	what kind of game?
2012-11-21 22:39:40	@intothev01d	do you use another type of versioning system?
2012-11-21 22:40:20	@intothev01d	its a 2d isometric puzzle game
2012-11-21 22:40:33	@intothev01d	it's died down a bit as everyone is busy with other things and it was a strict time limit, but we'll probably keep developing it or something similar even after the game off is over
2012-11-21 22:45:25	krystropolis	I'm working on coursera, and they have their own thing (codeskulptor)
2012-11-21 22:46:42	@intothev01d	ah
2012-11-21 22:47:21	krystropolis	i know code school has a git tutorial
2012-11-21 22:47:26	krystropolis	im avoiding it like the plague -_-
2012-11-21 22:47:46	@intothev01d	avoiding git?
2012-11-21 22:48:03	@intothev01d	it's actually really easy to understand the basics
2012-11-21 22:48:32	krystropolis	haha yeah avoiding it
2012-11-21 22:48:53	@intothev01d	it's not that bad
2012-11-21 22:49:13	krystropolis	all i see are words and symbols, it's a bit intimidating
2012-11-21 22:49:31	krystropolis	i know i just need to set time aside and do it
2012-11-21 22:49:54	@intothev01d	code is a whole bunch of words and symbols :D
2012-11-21 22:50:32	krystropolis	i know it is lol thats why I'm laughing at myself
2012-11-21 22:50:52	krystropolis	i signed up with git before i became familiar/comfortable with programming (because someone said i should) and since then I've been avoiding it
2012-11-21 22:51:13	krystropolis	now that i know about versions etc i want to use it.. esp so i can put my code on there for potential employers to take a peek at
2012-11-21 22:51:26	krystropolis	i just haven't gotten around to it
2012-11-21 22:53:01	@intothev01d	any decent prospective employer will also be using some sort of versioning system so it's really a good thing to know how one would work, even if it's not git (like subversion or mercurial)
2012-11-21 22:55:07	etb	though git is INarguably the best
2012-11-21 22:55:11	etb	:P
2012-11-21 22:56:08	@intothev01d	yea I like it as well
2012-11-21 23:04:47	Phenax	Sorry guys, but I'm repping mercurial. Because I learned it first, and haven't heard any compelling arguments to switch.
2012-11-21 23:04:49	Phenax	:P
2012-11-21 23:05:21	krystropolis	in the spirit of reddit… git has a kitty mascot
2012-11-21 23:05:44	@intothev01d	github has a kitty mascot
2012-11-21 23:05:49	@intothev01d	not git

2012-11-21 23:07:09	krystropolis	i didn't know there was a difference

2012-11-22 05:58:38	Phenax	Yeah, if that doesn't work than explicitly casting it should
2012-11-22 05:58:51	Corlay	yup works thanks
2012-11-22 06:00:15	Phenax	Alternatively
2012-11-22 06:00:25	Phenax	if you want to avoid explicit casting (some OOP people don't like it)
2012-11-22 06:00:32	Phenax	you can declare an abstract method to be overridden in ClassA
2012-11-22 06:00:36	Phenax	and override it in ClassB
2012-11-22 06:00:53	Corlay	ok
2012-11-22 06:01:03	Phenax	But if you're just results-driven than the previous answer is fine :)
2012-11-22 06:01:12	Phenax	Some people take programming paradigms more seriously than others.

2012-11-22 06:02:46	@NoaHall	that's not a good way to do it though - every subclass will now have to implement that useless method for no reason. Classes should be as reusable as possible, and contain the bare minimum of methods and properties needed

2012-11-24 11:58:20	BZA99	Hey all, I've been working on building a website dedicated to my college's baseball team. But I don't know what the term for what I'm doing is called, which means I've had a hard time getting help. Basically, I'd like to know if I'm "programming" or "coding" or doing neither - because I'd really like to read up on some tutorials to keep improving my site.
2012-11-24 11:59:09	pythocy	well, web developement is one name for that
2012-11-24 11:59:31	pythocy	it is programming if you're using something else than just HTML and CSS
2012-11-24 11:59:51	BZA99	Ohhh ok, awesome!
2012-11-24 12:00:01	pythocy	coding, according to my knowledge, means just writing code, which necessarily doesn't mean programming
2012-11-24 12:00:21	BZA99	I have only worked with HTML and CSS on this site.
2012-11-24 12:00:44	BZA99	Thanks for the clarification! So I mainly stick to HTML/CSS tutorials?
2012-11-24 12:00:55	BZA99	should^
2012-11-24 12:01:51	pythocy	well, depends on what you are planning to do
2012-11-24 12:02:01	@intothev01d	if you write code then you're programming. coding and programming are one in the same http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming
2012-11-24 12:02:08	pythocy	if there's just info, maybe some pics and videos, then yes, html and css are enough
2012-11-24 12:02:41	pythocy	intothev01d, but html and css aren't programming languages, right?
2012-11-24 12:02:49	@intothev01d	correct, they are not
2012-11-24 12:03:37	BZA99	Ok ok, this makes a lot more sense now.
2012-11-24 12:04:01	@intothev01d	HTML is a markup language for web pages
2012-11-24 12:04:11	BZA99	And yes, I've kept it somewhat simple (modeling it after the sports-reference.com pages) and played around with posting pics/embedding videos
2012-11-24 12:04:31	@intothev01d	CSS is just for styling those pages
2012-11-24 12:04:54	BZA99	Styling as in, adding scripts and such or just adding fancier touchups?
2012-11-24 12:06:14	pythocy	styling is just making website look like something
2012-11-24 12:06:40	BZA99	Ok, gotcha!
2012-11-24 12:06:43	pythocy	scripting is done with javascript, php, python or something else

2012-11-24 12:07:08	BZA99	So scripting is its own language?
2012-11-24 12:07:35	pythocy	no, scripting isn't a language :D
2012-11-24 12:07:41	BZA99	oh man....

2012-11-24 12:07:51	BZA99	my brain hurts now
2012-11-24 12:07:52	pythocy	but what i meant was that there are languages for scripting :)
2012-11-24 12:08:01	pythocy	like javascript
2012-11-24 12:08:31	BZA99	gotcha. I know when I talked to someone at the student tech. center they mentioned javascript would likely be necessary
2012-11-24 12:08:54	pythocy	html is for making the website, css is for making it look like something, and scripts make it do something

2012-11-24 12:09:38	BZA99	so a script does something like letting a user click on a link or is it more like letting a user upload a photo?
2012-11-24 12:12:00	pythocy	scripts are more advanced, links are made with html
2012-11-24 12:12:28	@intothev01d	think of it like this. javascript is mainly the frontend dynamic information (like showing something popping up on hover or expanding a tab or something). html and css are for static layout and design of the webpage. you can actually use javascript to edit those on the client side as well. the backend of a website that works with a database is usually some language like python, ruby, c++ etc.
2012-11-24 12:12:48	@intothev01d	php as well
2012-11-24 12:13:51	BZA99	Ohhhhhh gotcha ok ok that's cool
2012-11-24 12:14:21	BZA99	well, I guess I'm going to hit the HTML/CSS books and dive in again - really appreciate everyone's help and timely answers! Thanks a bunch!

2012-11-27 10:59:42	@intothev01d	no n is the total of numbers they enter or the length of the array
2012-11-27 10:59:56	@intothev01d	the 1-49 are possible choices for each element in the array
2012-11-27 11:00:21	ario	so i don't need to generate a random number in this case
2012-11-27 11:00:31	@intothev01d	so if I enter 3 numbers, 1, 7, 23 then n will be 3 and element 0 = 1, 1= 7, 2 = 23
2012-11-27 11:02:06	@intothev01d	n is whatever they pass into the function GenerateDraw it seems. so however many random numbers it needs to have between 1-49
2012-11-27 11:02:36	@intothev01d	so if i say generateDraw(3) then it would generate 3 random numbers and return an array of length n = 3
2012-11-27 11:03:01	ario	ah
2012-11-27 11:07:23	ario	so if the user enters 2 numbers
2012-11-27 11:07:41	ario	it should generate 4 random numbers?
2012-11-27 11:07:49	ario	or
2012-11-27 11:07:50	@intothev01d	why would it generate 4?
2012-11-27 11:08:25	ario	ack i'm still thinking we need arry of length = 6
2012-11-27 11:08:35	ario	so it's basically:

2012-11-29 16:32:52	M3OWMlX	I'm a c++ beginner, and I have a question: is it possible to duplicate an array, but it's values are in reverse by just using pointers? (a[1] = 1, a[2] =2) -> (b[1]=2, b[2]=1)
2012-11-29 16:33:07	M3OWMlX	here's what I have so far, i'm probably going to wrong way about this. http://pastebin.com/wVHQUyiU
2012-11-29 16:35:26	biio	it should work, but that way you're doing there doesn't use only pointers,unless I'm reading it wrong
2012-11-29 16:36:07	M3OWMlX	Yes, it's returning the values backwords, but only as a cout >>. What I'd like is to create a new array so that it isn't as temporary
2012-11-29 16:37:30	@intothev01d	why can't you just print them in reverse order from the original array?
2012-11-29 16:37:50	biio	unrelated maybe, but at line 59, (i-(i-1))+1, should end up as always being +2, no?
2012-11-29 16:38:17	M3OWMlX	intothev01d: It's an assignment that requires me to make a new array.
2012-11-29 16:38:48	@chance_z	M3OWMlX: just loop through the array in reverse
2012-11-29 16:38:53	@intothev01d	so then just copy the array into a new one the way you would fill one normally starting at the end of the original array working to the begining
2012-11-29 16:39:33	@chance_z	basically make a new array which has the same size as the other array, then to add values you just do a foor loop that iterates from the end to the beginning

2012-11-29 16:41:22	biio	I'm sorry for filling the chat with questions maybe dragging attention away from your problem, but would line 21 not just end up with an array full of adressess to each element in numbers[] ?

2012-11-29 16:44:50	@chance_z	M3OWMlX: an array is just a pointer to the first element
2012-11-29 16:44:53	biio	does your assignment require you to work only with pointers? because using indexes like that would not have been allowed by the TA's in my c courses then
2012-11-29 16:45:31	@chance_z	but i wouldnt use pointers for this
2012-11-29 16:45:34	@chance_z	you should use a copy
2012-11-29 16:45:40	@chance_z	and copy these values to the new array
2012-11-29 16:45:57	@chance_z	if you edit the reversed array then you'll be editing the original array
2012-11-29 16:45:58	@chance_z	which you probably dont want
2012-11-29 16:46:35	biio	chance_z: you'd have to go trough the array to copy it though, then pointers could be good, no?
2012-11-29 16:47:01	@chance_z	you have to go through the array anyways
2012-11-29 16:47:10	M3OWMlX	the wording in the question is wierd "write a function that accepts an int array and create a copy of the array, except it's values should be reversed. this function (reverseArray()) should return to a pointer to the new array"
2012-11-29 16:47:18	@chance_z	your going to have to iterate over the values regardless
2012-11-29 16:47:27	@chance_z	M3OWMlX: so you want a pointer to the new one
2012-11-29 16:47:42	@chance_z	you want to first make a new array which is the same length as the other one

2012-11-29 16:49:39	@chance_z	then you would do a for loop like this: for (int i = 0; i < original_array_length; i++) { newarray[i] = originalarray[arraylength-i] }
2012-11-29 16:49:52	@chance_z	that loop would be part of your reverseArray
2012-11-29 16:50:14	@chance_z	and you would return *newarray
2012-11-29 16:50:51	@chance_z	make sure you allocate new array with new otherwise you can't return the pointer as it'll be taken off the stack after the function returns

2012-11-29 16:58:26	@intothev01d	then at the end, when you no longer need it, you need to use delete [] arrayName
2012-11-29 17:00:29	@intothev01d	everything else looks ok though
2012-11-29 17:01:12	@intothev01d	oh and once it's declared you don't need the type in front anymore there in the for loop on line 28
2012-11-29 17:01:49	@intothev01d	or the * at that point

2012-11-29 17:03:43	M3OWMlX	VS says that at line 28, subscript requires array or pointer type.
2012-11-29 17:03:56	@intothev01d	back in main you'll also need something to hold the return of that function as well. right now you're just calling it
2012-11-29 17:04:06	M3OWMlX	when I do reverse(numbers), does it pass all values of numbers into the function or just the first
2012-11-29 17:04:42	@intothev01d	you're passing an array to the function, so yes it passes whatever is in your array to it
2012-11-29 17:04:50	M3OWMlX	line 24, i forgot brackets
2012-11-29 17:17:27	M3OWMlX	http://pastebin.com/AYdyy8y8 I don't even know anymore. :(
2012-11-29 17:18:12	@intothev01d	what do you not know?
2012-11-29 17:18:31	@intothev01d	did you read the link i posted about dynamic arrays
2012-11-29 17:19:24	M3OWMlX	what does 'new' do?
2012-11-29 17:19:29	@intothev01d	dynamically allocates memory for the array
2012-11-29 17:22:23	M3OWMlX		int *numbersPtr[size];
2012-11-29 17:22:24	M3OWMlX		numbersPtr[size]= new (nothrow) int[size];
2012-11-29 17:22:26	M3OWMlX	do i need the first line there?
2012-11-29 17:24:19	@intothev01d	in the reverse function
2012-11-29 17:24:29	@intothev01d	int *numArray;
2012-11-29 17:24:49	@intothev01d	numArray = new int [size];

2012-11-29 21:08:12	hexchat11	To make a website that incorporates user accounts/changing content, I should learn/use PHP, right? I know some PHP, html.
2012-11-29 21:10:57	etb	yes, php is a server-side scripting language best suited for dynamic web page generation
2012-11-29 21:12:32	etb	a good combo is PHP, MySQL (through php's PDO), jQuery (javascript), HTML5 and CSS

2012-11-29 21:13:01	hexchat11	Thanks, I'll get started on the PHP I suppose.
2012-11-29 21:13:14	djr_	start on html
2012-11-29 21:13:23	hexchat11	I know some HTML
2012-11-29 21:13:55	djr_	i would recommend running through some basic html/css stuff until you can comfortably make some stuff with it
2012-11-29 21:14:07	djr_	maybe throw some javascript in after that, then setup a server and add some php
2012-11-29 21:14:20	djr_	dunno
2012-11-29 21:14:23	djr_	no right order i guess
2012-11-29 21:14:50	djr_	there's some alright tutorials at htmldog.com for html/css
2012-11-29 21:15:04	etb	djr_ is right, it's a good idea to know how the output of your php (which is html) should look
2012-11-29 21:15:09	etb	but you can do them concurrently
2012-11-29 21:15:30	hexchat11	Thanks for the help!

2012-12-01 17:53:46	Latros	is there a way to do a large cross-check with "string.Contains()"?
2012-12-01 17:54:02	@chance_z	what do you mean
2012-12-01 17:54:11	Latros	EG, for an in if statement, I don't want -- "string.Contains("1") || string.contains("2") || etc etc"
2012-12-01 17:54:21	@chance_z	ory
2012-12-01 17:54:23	@chance_z	oops
2012-12-01 17:54:25	Latros	just ONE "string.Contains("-- all the stuff I don't want here --")'
2012-12-01 17:55:09	@chance_z	use a loop over the items you dont want
2012-12-01 17:56:04	Latros	im confused
2012-12-01 17:56:42	Latros	basically i want users to input their username, but it cant include "! ? , ; -" etc
2012-12-01 17:56:48	Latros	what's the best way to go about that?
2012-12-01 17:57:05	@chance_z	well there is usually an 'isDigit' or 'isAlpha' method
2012-12-01 17:57:08	@chance_z	but
2012-12-01 17:57:22	@chance_z	what language is this?
2012-12-01 17:59:18	odavid	hi
2012-12-01 17:59:41	@chance_z	hi
2012-12-01 18:00:34	odavid	how are you
2012-12-01 18:01:10	Latros	c# chance_z
2012-12-01 18:01:10	Latros	sorry
2012-12-01 18:01:19	biio	Latros: if it's java I would have done something like: http://privatepaste.com/81ab41f702
2012-12-01 18:01:50	biio	I havent tried that code so not sure it runs, but you get the idea, and it should be similar in C#
2012-12-01 18:02:35	Latros	ooh
2012-12-01 18:02:35	Latros	i see what you did!
2012-12-01 18:02:50	Latros	(And im new so i am going to verbalize this to see if I understand it)
2012-12-01 18:02:59	Latros	create an array of strings of things that arent allowed
2012-12-01 18:02:59	biio	actually, the status boolean became useless there :p
2012-12-01 18:03:16	Latros	then ran a for loop to cross reference their input with every individual element of said array
2012-12-01 18:03:34	Latros	and if it matches or contains any, not let them
2012-12-01 18:03:34	Latros	basically
2012-12-01 18:03:34	biio	exactly
2012-12-01 18:03:45	Latros	ok neat :) thanks! i forget about tricks like that
2012-12-01 18:04:23	odavid	http://soundcloud.com/davidobriensounds
2012-12-01 18:04:27	odavid	just uploaded some improvs
2012-12-01 18:04:37	odavid	let me know what you think of them
2012-12-01 18:05:49	biio	holy hell, my code there is so full of crap, no method name, status just taking up space, missing ; on return and it always checks element 0 and not i
2012-12-01 18:05:49	biio	:D
2012-12-01 18:06:22	@chance_z	you could also regex
2012-12-01 18:06:24	@chance_z	where
2012-12-01 18:06:28	@chance_z	you strip anything in the regex
2012-12-01 18:06:33	@chance_z	might be slow
2012-12-01 18:08:22	biio	not sure which would be faster, but another alternative if you dont want to allow special characters at all would be removing everything that isn't a letter or number, then checking if the resulting string still has anything in it, if so, return false
2012-12-01 18:11:21	Latros	and yeah C# is almost identical to java
2012-12-01 18:11:21	Latros	i love it
2012-12-01 18:11:31	Latros	(as a former minecraft plugin coder, EG java)
2012-12-01 18:11:43	Latros	very easy transition into C# .NET
2012-12-01 18:11:46	@intothev01d	if you remove anything that is not a letter or string you would be left with letters and strings if there are any, therefore returning false. so I'm not sure how that would work really
2012-12-01 18:12:13	@intothev01d	replace string in my above statement with numbers
2012-12-01 18:13:03	@chance_z	intothev01d: regardless you can check the ending result after stripping it
2012-12-01 18:13:11	Latros	semantics
2012-12-01 18:13:12	@chance_z	and whatever is left will not have those particular characters
2012-12-01 18:13:25	biio	I'm guessing this would end up being slightly more efficient: http://privatepaste.com/5c9f671872
2012-12-01 18:13:38	@chance_z	and from there check normal stuff like length or if it already exists
2012-12-01 18:13:38	@intothev01d	I thought you were just checking if they put in special characters, not removing them
2012-12-01 18:13:55	@intothev01d	i like the is alphaNumeric idea
2012-12-01 18:13:56	@chance_z	you might just use a regex
2012-12-01 18:14:21	@intothev01d	regex yes that too
2012-12-01 18:14:26	@chance_z	oh
2012-12-01 18:14:28	@chance_z	right
2012-12-01 18:14:34	@chance_z	well you can still skip the replace part
2012-12-01 18:14:41	@intothev01d	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6183379/check-alphanumeric-characters-in-string-in-c-sharp
2012-12-01 18:14:59	@chance_z	thats what I was going to suggest

2012-12-01 18:15:05	@chance_z	same thing in python
2012-12-01 18:15:07	@chance_z	:)
2012-12-01 18:15:21	@intothev01d	yep
2012-12-01 18:15:29	@intothev01d	that's prob the best/most efficient way
2012-12-01 18:15:37	@chance_z	yeah
2012-12-01 18:15:45	@chance_z	make sure you ues the c# imp he used
2012-12-01 18:15:48	@chance_z	since the regex for white space is slightly different
2012-12-01 18:15:51	@chance_z	as you can see
2012-12-01 18:16:14	@chance_z	pianobar stopped working recently
2012-12-01 18:16:17	@chance_z	:(
2012-12-01 18:18:20	@intothev01d	I think there should be an isalnum() check as well for C#, there is one for C++
2012-12-01 18:18:38	@chance_z	yeah
2012-12-01 18:18:44	@chance_z	id think so
2012-12-01 18:19:54	@intothev01d	wonder which would be faster, the regex checking or the loop to check for the first non alphanumeric character in the string
2012-12-01 18:20:21	@chance_z	do it to a string thats like 100,000 long
2012-12-01 18:20:24	@chance_z	or something
2012-12-01 18:20:27	@intothev01d	yea
2012-12-01 18:20:29	@chance_z	or 1000 would work
2012-12-01 18:20:34	@chance_z	i dont have the C# compiler installed
2012-12-01 18:20:38	@chance_z	so i cant do it
2012-12-01 18:20:41	@chance_z	:(
2012-12-01 18:21:03	@intothev01d	me either
2012-12-01 18:21:06	@intothev01d	but it would be the same type of thing for python if it has something similar
2012-12-01 18:21:29	@chance_z	ones compiled one isnt
2012-12-01 18:21:36	@chance_z	the way regex works im pretty sure is different
2012-12-01 18:21:38	@chance_z	well
2012-12-01 18:21:41	@chance_z	id
2012-12-01 18:21:55	@chance_z	idk
2012-12-01 18:21:55	@chance_z	internally
2012-12-01 18:21:55	@chance_z	some also run on different regex engine types which matters
2012-12-01 18:22:23	@intothev01d	interesting
2012-12-01 18:23:05	@intothev01d	I'm kind of nitpicking probably a non issue but was just curious :D
2012-12-01 18:23:22	@intothev01d	I fall into the premature optimizations sometimes, but I guess at scale you really have to look for every performance boost you can
2012-12-01 18:24:23	@chance_z	lol
2012-12-01 18:24:27	@chance_z	depends
2012-12-01 18:24:29	@intothev01d	my profs are always talking about how back in the day you could get paid really well if you could just simplify stuff by removing a line of code or checks here and there (because of the memory constraints, file sizes)
2012-12-01 18:24:31	biio	I'm taking a course that is all about efficiency and speed, it has damaged me :p
2012-12-01 18:25:11	@intothev01d	it's interesting to think about optimization and how much little stuff can really affect things as a whole
2012-12-01 18:26:11	biio	last year we did some coding on 8Hz machines, I'd like to get access to them again to see how the things I've learned since then would improve the speed of our code

2012-12-03 00:17:47	Latros	anybody not AFK?
2012-12-03 00:18:15	Latros	my friend and I have a question regarding instantiation of classes
2012-12-03 00:18:18	Latros	instanciation?
2012-12-03 00:18:22	Latros	anyway.
2012-12-03 00:18:42	Latros	we have a "zombie" class
2012-12-03 00:18:55	Latros	we want to have random battles where 1-4 zombies are spawned
2012-12-03 00:19:07	Latros	how can we "randomize" how many instances of "Zombie" that we instantiate?
2012-12-03 00:19:35	Latros	EG: we cant do a for loop and do:        Zombie zombie = new Zombie();       because doing that 1-4 times will overwrite the previous instance of zombie within memory

2012-12-03 00:20:55	@chance_z	in what language, c++?
2012-12-03 00:20:57	@chance_z	make an array
2012-12-03 00:21:14	@chance_z	or a battle class
2012-12-03 00:21:17	Latros	C#
2012-12-03 00:21:25	Latros	and an array of what?
2012-12-03 00:21:25	Latros	o.O
2012-12-03 00:21:32	@chance_z	and have the battle class do a random number of them and store them into an array
2012-12-03 00:21:35	Latros	an array of instances?
2012-12-03 00:21:38	@chance_z	yeah
2012-12-03 00:21:55	Latros	but thats the issue we're having, that very statement, "have it do a random number of them"
2012-12-03 00:22:08	Latros	how do you do a random number of    Zombie zombie = new Zombie();            when doing that twice
2012-12-03 00:22:15	Latros	overwrites the first one
2012-12-03 00:22:15	Latros	(and so on)
2012-12-03 00:22:55	@chance_z	something like num_zombies = random.random(3)
2012-12-03 00:23:15	Latros	right
2012-12-03 00:23:25	Latros	but then that would TRY and do                 Zombie zombie = new Zombie()        3 times
2012-12-03 00:23:25	Latros	which wont work
2012-12-03 00:23:32	@chance_z	Zombie *zombies_array;
2012-12-03 00:23:56	@chance_z	for (i = 0; i < num_zombies; i++) { zombies_array[i] = new Zombie(); }
2012-12-03 00:24:02	@chance_z	something like that
2012-12-03 00:24:03	@chance_z	idk c#
2012-12-03 00:24:17	Latros	are you saying create a predefined list of zombie variable names?
2012-12-03 00:24:25	@chance_z	no
2012-12-03 00:24:37	Latros	oh wait
2012-12-03 00:24:55	@chance_z	you create a random number that will be your number of zombies, and then loop that many times to create that many zombies
2012-12-03 00:25:05	@chance_z	and you put each one in an array the size of num_zombies
2012-12-03 00:25:17	@chance_z	oh i forgot to declare the size
2012-12-03 00:25:25	Latros	for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++){                Zombie zombie_array[i] = new Zombie();         }
2012-12-03 00:25:25	Latros	^
2012-12-03 00:25:25	Latros	?
2012-12-03 00:25:45	Latros	essentially?
2012-12-03 00:25:45	@chance_z	Zombie *zombies = new Zombie[num_zombies]; or something
2012-12-03 00:25:45	@chance_z	in C++
2012-12-03 00:25:45	@chance_z	no
2012-12-03 00:25:47	@chance_z	you declare it first
2012-12-03 00:25:55	@chance_z	and then assign the value
2012-12-03 00:25:55	@chance_z	you cant re-decare in a loop
2012-12-03 00:29:15	@chance_z	http://www.dotnetperls.com/object-array
2012-12-03 00:29:57	@chance_z	use random to get a number of zombies
2012-12-03 00:30:01	@chance_z	and then make an array that big
2012-12-03 00:30:26	@chance_z	then loop through the array, calling the constructor to create a new object for each location in the array
2012-12-03 00:40:25	Latros	confusing
2012-12-03 00:40:30	@chance_z	do you need help still?
2012-12-03 00:43:41	Latros	I think we changed our minds with how we're doing it so as to avoid that complication
2012-12-03 00:43:52	spitfire4	it's not that complicated
2012-12-03 00:44:01	spitfire4	instead of one zombie
2012-12-03 00:44:03	Latros	For this particular app it will only cause headaches to have our turn-based combat have multiple enemies per fight
2012-12-03 00:44:26	@chance_z	its not that hard to implement a random number of zombies
2012-12-03 00:44:46	@chance_z	if your talking about with the game logic of play with that, then yeah me. maybe not.
2012-12-03 00:46:16	Latros	the game logic :P
2012-12-03 00:46:30	Latros	our current turn based system won't really support multiple enemies
2012-12-03 00:46:47	Latros	so its better to avoid that headache entirely right now (for this version, anyway)
2012-12-03 00:48:22	@chance_z	ah
2012-12-03 00:48:43	@chance_z	is this being written with anything?

2012-12-07 19:31:43	@intothev01d	well one thing Im not totally familiar with java syntax, but doesn't your main gui class need to be located after your declarations of other classes like the staff class (should it be under that?
2012-12-07 19:32:53	jayayseakay	it is isnt it?
2012-12-07 19:33:02	@intothev01d	um no, you pasted it anyway where your gui class private void LoginActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) is above everything else
2012-12-07 19:33:27	@intothev01d	and your staff class is there at the very bottom
2012-12-07 19:33:28	jayayseakay	just the program im having is looping through a list of 'Users' which have a derived class of Staff, so im wanting to check through each Staff in a SetOfUsers
2012-12-07 19:33:33	jayayseakay	no no they are in different files :)
2012-12-07 19:33:38	jayayseakay	i just pasted it in like that

2012-12-08 14:28:26	@intothev01d	prob easiest way is to pass another variable (like a boolean or something) to the get deposit and withdraw which would indicate whether or not it is d_account1. then in the method you can check for true/false 0/1 and in the method calls you would pass 0 or false for the c_account1 methods and 1 or true for d_account

2012-12-08 15:52:45	pythocy	i recently installed arch linux on my laptop, and i like it's package manager (pacman) very much, but i'd still like to have a simple gui for it
2012-12-08 15:53:14	pythocy	i know that there are lots of gui frontends for pacman, but i thought that maybe I'd try to write one myself
2012-12-08 15:53:52	pythocy	but is there something like "os.system("[COMMAND HERE]")" in C++?
2012-12-08 15:54:03	pythocy	that a c++ program could run some other program/command?
2012-12-08 15:54:28	Phenax	#include <stdlib.h>
2012-12-08 15:54:39	Phenax	system("[COMMAND HERE]");
2012-12-08 15:55:50	Phenax	You probably want the output as well, though.
2012-12-08 15:55:50	pythocy	oh, so it was so simple :D
2012-12-08 15:56:10	pythocy	well, actually right now i just need to run one command :D
2012-12-08 15:57:22	Phenax	Ah well, when you run into the roadblock of needing to get the output of a command, if you decide to, you have to use the popen function instead, and treat it like an input stream.
2012-12-08 15:57:22	Phenax	(i.e., use fgets or something)
2012-12-08 15:58:35	pythocy	okay, thank you very much :)

2012-12-08 16:02:25	Phenax	Indeed, if there is some API or way to access something, it is far preferable than running commands directly, which is often considered insecure & inefficient.

2012-12-08 17:00:05	tangentstorm	... why is that preferable, phenax?
2012-12-08 17:00:54	Phenax	Lets say you have a box that says "Enter a package to install" and the user types ";rm -rf /" then he will get pooped on..
2012-12-08 17:01:23	Phenax	I know it can be avoided, but, there are just extra security issues, and also it only gives you text back which you have to restructure to the proper data structure you use
2012-12-08 17:01:38	Phenax	I'm sure the library includes a better structure than text.
2012-12-08 17:01:54	Phenax	That's why you hear so much about SQL vulnerabilities - because a lot of (less than good) SQL developers run commands directly
2012-12-08 17:02:23	@intothev01d	sql injection
2012-12-08 17:02:43	Phenax	So basically, it's just more secure, and less work. Yea, you *can* do it securely, but it requires many more checks.

2012-12-08 17:03:25	Phenax	Although for the most part stuff like that is important on networked systems, on a local system you're protecting the user from his own stupidity, or the user from a malicious program that could try to exploit your program.
2012-12-08 17:03:50	Phenax	Or possible bugs in your software
2012-12-08 17:03:51	@Enalicho	Indeed. And the problem is that a lot of web developers in web dev shops tend to be self-taught people who do things because they work - not because they're the best way to do it, or the most secure way to do it
2012-12-08 17:07:53	@intothev01d	yea, self teaching sometimes doesn't follow best practices, especially with security. I think that comes from lack  of formal training. I myself didn't know some of that until I found out through others and by going to a security conference. a lot of tutorials are out there randomly too, some right and others wrong so
2012-12-08 17:08:30	tangentstorm	unix is broken
2012-12-08 17:09:53	tangentstorm	yeah, you guys are right. the problem is that text is completely untyped and requires parsing, but there's still that paradigm of separate applications.
2012-12-08 17:10:53	tangentstorm	i agree with everything you all just said, but it conflicts with the basic unix philosophy of having small well factored tools that do one thing well
2012-12-08 17:11:13	tangentstorm	the problem is the text
2012-12-08 17:11:53	tangentstorm	shared libraries provide a well typed alternative, but unfortunately they don't get passed around in streams like text information
2012-12-08 17:11:58	@intothev01d	wouldn't the problem be interoperability then?
2012-12-08 17:11:59	tangentstorm	so you have two completely different ways to do the same thing and they're at odds with each other :/
2012-12-08 17:12:59	tangentstorm	i wanted to argue with you when you said just call the library, but i also agree and that's why ":("
2012-12-08 17:13:02	tangentstorm	hrm...
2012-12-08 17:13:24	tangentstorm	intothev01d: isn't that already the problem now?
2012-12-08 17:13:44	tangentstorm	when you call a library and some other code wants to call a different version of the same library?
2012-12-08 17:13:57	tangentstorm	so you have packaging to deal with that
2012-12-08 17:14:29	tangentstorm	the only difference is that in one case the data is flowing throug a pipe, and in the other case it's using the call stack
2012-12-08 17:14:30	@intothev01d	oh no i was just thinking along the lines of having one thing do only the one thing
2012-12-08 17:15:13	tangentstorm	that's the "unix philosophy" :)  composition of lots of small tools
2012-12-08 17:15:39	@intothev01d	yea but I think that works well
2012-12-08 17:15:39	tangentstorm	what we have is a situation of local optima now
2012-12-08 17:16:26	tangentstorm	lots of well factored applications leading to an ill factored global system
2012-12-08 17:16:38	@Enalicho	Indeed. I read a good blog post about how the old Unix philosophy of "Do one job and do it well" would be pretty crappy these days
2012-12-08 17:16:53	tangentstorm	intothev01d: maybe i didn't understand what you were talking about when you said (" wouldn't the problem be interoperability then?")
2012-12-08 17:17:15	@Enalicho	So these days I just stick to a subpackage per task
2012-12-08 17:17:32	tangentstorm	oh.. you think the call stack works well
2012-12-08 17:17:43	@intothev01d	I guess what I was thinking is would having something do only one thing affect its ability to work with something else
2012-12-08 17:18:15	@intothev01d	I don't know really but I can see the idea behind specific tools for specific jobs, but something has to manage them too
2012-12-08 17:18:17	tangentstorm	Enalicho: i'd like to read that
2012-12-08 17:19:13	tangentstorm	having a tool that does one thing only increases its ability to work with something else
2012-12-08 17:19:53	tangentstorm	like the original question here, for example
2012-12-08 17:19:53	@intothev01d	oh yea that's a good point, not interference
2012-12-08 17:19:53	@intothev01d	no*
2012-12-08 17:19:53	tangentstorm	you build a separate application for each thing you want to do
2012-12-08 17:20:18	tangentstorm	and the thing you do on the command line and on the gui and maybe on the web are all separate
2012-12-08 17:20:21	tangentstorm	but they all just duplicate each other
2012-12-08 17:20:39	tangentstorm	and the gui you make is only specific to the one tool underneath
2012-12-08 17:21:29	@Enalicho	Hmm, can't find it
2012-12-08 17:21:53	@Enalicho	http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/06/30/where-the-unix-philosophy-breaks-down/
2012-12-08 17:21:53	@Enalicho	That's similar to it
2012-12-08 17:22:14	@intothev01d	thats how my prof explains how we should program, in small functions limited to only one thing when possible
2012-12-08 17:22:14	tangentstorm	thanks
2012-12-08 17:22:48	@chance_z	i still agree with the unix philosophy
2012-12-08 17:22:48	@intothev01d	it's a good idea, seeing as it narrows down problems and isolates certain things to happening in certain areas
2012-12-08 17:22:48	@chance_z	thats why i prefer flask to django
2012-12-08 17:23:02	@chance_z	you get people trying to build these great tools that do everything they want, yet they end up builing a collection of things that are alright
2012-12-08 17:23:10	@Enalicho	intothev01d: Indeed - and that's why languages like Haskell help you become better programmers, because they *force* you to do one thing and one thing only unless you explicitly say that it may have side effects
2012-12-08 17:23:18	@chance_z	if they built one 'really good' thing than put it together with existing good things, it would work better.
2012-12-08 17:23:33	tangentstorm	this right here: "When you have to switch software applications, that’s a transaction cost."
2012-12-08 17:24:09	tangentstorm	he says that to explain why you have to duplicate it
2012-12-08 17:24:41	tangentstorm	the premise is that you have to switch applications.
2012-12-08 17:25:11	tangentstorm	why do you need applications to begin with?
2012-12-08 17:25:11	@chance_z	The hard part isn’t writing little programs that do one thing well. The hard part is combining little programs to solve bigger problems.
2012-12-08 17:26:29	 *	tangentstorm just wants one program with all the features :)
2012-12-08 17:27:23	Amadiro	I love the way the broadcomm chip on the raspberry pi overlays video and OpenGL output on the screen
2012-12-08 17:27:23	Amadiro	really ghetto
2012-12-08 17:27:38	Amadiro	you don't get your video in a window or anything, it just gets blitted directly to the screen, on top of everything else
2012-12-08 17:27:44	Amadiro	the xserver doesn't even see a window or anything
2012-12-08 17:29:06	tangentstorm	yes!
2012-12-08 17:29:11	tangentstorm	that's what i want
2012-12-08 17:30:25	tangentstorm	like a grid of text in console mode intermingled with graphics if i want to draw graphics... video... just everything all mixed up in the same place
2012-12-08 17:30:46	Amadiro	tangentstorm, so basically a framebuffer?

2012-12-10 12:17:20	Diablodoc	haha no prob mate :3
2012-12-10 12:18:00	Diablodoc	I also wrote an article criticizing linux mentality (despite how radical it sounds) if you wanna check it out
2012-12-10 12:18:18	Diablodoc	as a before-note: I love open source myself
2012-12-10 12:18:56	--	Diablodoc is now known as Diablodoct0r
2012-12-10 12:20:01	carefish	i have to add, i'm a newbie programmer
2012-12-10 12:20:26	carefish	started about a year ago w/ C#, now moved on to C++
2012-12-10 12:21:15	Diablodoct0r	nice
2012-12-10 12:21:18	Diablodoct0r	I code as well
2012-12-10 12:21:19	Diablodoct0r	^^
2012-12-10 12:21:29	Diablodoct0r	newbie at what I'm doing atm too
2012-12-10 12:21:43	carefish	heh, i study game development
2012-12-10 12:21:59	Diablodoct0r	that's my lane as well
2012-12-10 12:22:03	carefish	although the school i'm at doesn't teach c#/c++
2012-12-10 12:22:26	Diablodoct0r	Currently gone from pascal to Unity, needing C# for the team
2012-12-10 12:22:27	Diablodoct0r	aww
2012-12-10 12:22:35	carefish	the school i'm currently at
2012-12-10 12:22:39	carefish	focusses on game art
2012-12-10 12:22:49	carefish	so at first i learned a bit of AS3/flash
2012-12-10 12:23:01	tangentstorm	what kind of person programs in PASCAL?? :)
2012-12-10 12:23:06	carefish	quickly dumped that shit because debugging gave me headaches
2012-12-10 12:23:32	Diablodoct0r	tangentstorm: You'd be amazed at what Delphi can do today
2012-12-10 12:23:43	Diablodoct0r	more efficient than C++ if you ask me
2012-12-10 12:24:01	Diablodoct0r	I wrote an article on that too
2012-12-10 12:24:16	tangentstorm	Diablodoct0r: i'm joking. i've been talking about pascal in here for weeks and everybody just looks at me like i'm crazy :)
2012-12-10 12:24:23	Diablodoct0r	hahahaha wow
2012-12-10 12:24:32	Diablodoct0r	well yeah, the new Delphi's looking pretty great
2012-12-10 12:24:34	Diablodoct0r	XE2 and above
2012-12-10 12:24:54	Diablodoct0r	I got XE2
2012-12-10 12:24:54	tangentstorm	well. i don't know that for sure... but the voices in my head tell me they're all looking at me like i'm crazy.
2012-12-10 12:24:54	Diablodoct0r	Trust me, they are.
2012-12-10 12:24:54	tangentstorm	never used it.
2012-12-10 12:25:02	Diablodoct0r	Well let me put it this way
2012-12-10 12:25:03	tangentstorm	i use freepascal
2012-12-10 12:25:03	Diablodoct0r	ah
2012-12-10 12:25:06	Diablodoct0r	Lazarus?
2012-12-10 12:25:25	Diablodoct0r	I used that also back in the day, but it seems the commercial Delphi suddenly took leaps beyond
2012-12-10 12:25:32	carefish	is pascal difficult to get in to?
2012-12-10 12:25:33	Diablodoct0r	I wouldn't say so
2012-12-10 12:25:48	Diablodoct0r	It's a coding language like any other
2012-12-10 12:26:09	tangentstorm	a little. mostly i got back into it because i wanted to clean up some of my old turbo pascal 5.5 code, so i mostly just stick to the command line stuff for now
2012-12-10 12:26:09	carefish	good, i'll have to put that on my todo list
2012-12-10 12:26:09	Diablodoct0r	carefish: If you can get into pascal, I'd say it's the best thing you do.
2012-12-10 12:26:09	carefish	i'm currently in love w/ C++
2012-12-10 12:26:11	Diablodoct0r	It's a lot cleaner and more bug free, and also forces you to do cleaner programming, with stronger type checking, than C++
2012-12-10 12:26:15	carefish	everyday i learn something new
2012-12-10 12:26:32	Diablodoct0r	It's also a lot more efficient
2012-12-10 12:26:34	Diablodoct0r	But yeah, I imagine it's fun with C++ too
2012-12-10 12:26:54	Diablodoct0r	I would recommend Delphi though
2012-12-10 12:26:55	Diablodoct0r	Delphi = the IDE that uses Pascal
2012-12-10 12:26:56	carefish	heh, i'm making a game engine right now

2012-12-10 12:27:17	tangentstorm	carefish: https://github.com/tangentstorm/cardinalrule  is a small thing i made in flash pascal... you can see what it looks like compared to as/3
2012-12-10 12:27:22	carefish	right now implementing javascript scripting support

2012-12-10 12:28:06	Diablodoct0r	Hey btw
2012-12-10 12:28:08	tangentstorm	are you doing ludum dare this weekend?
2012-12-10 12:28:10	carefish	i can load a sprite, can render it, now adding audio support
2012-12-10 12:28:32	carefish	nope tangentstorm, i don't think i'm a good enough programmer
2012-12-10 12:28:47	tangentstorm	eh so what? it's fun :)
2012-12-10 12:29:03	tangentstorm	game jams give you permission to make a crappy game in 48-72 hours
2012-12-10 12:29:20	carefish	heh, i love game jams though
2012-12-10 12:29:34	carefish	last time i did one i was proj/dev lead
2012-12-10 12:29:56	tangentstorm	i'm scrambling to finish up a compiler for a pascal-like language that compiles to javascript so i can make a game next weekend

2012-12-10 12:31:10	carefish	hmm

2012-12-10 12:31:37	carefish	eventually you'll be able to make a game using js only
2012-12-10 12:32:23	tangentstorm	like a browser game? or like a standalone native app scripted in js?
2012-12-10 12:32:41	carefish	the .exe compiles the javascript to machinecode which then gets executed
2012-12-10 12:33:13	tangentstorm	cool :)
2012-12-10 12:33:25	carefish	once i've got the basics covered, audio/drawing/user input, i'm planning to make it crossplatform
2012-12-10 12:33:26	tangentstorm	that doesn't sound like a beginner project
2012-12-10 12:33:53	carefish	i like to set the bar high :) and i like to think of myself as a fast learner
2012-12-10 12:34:10	tangentstorm	right on

2012-12-10 12:35:00	carefish	that yellow ball is loaded using LoadSprite() from the js file
2012-12-10 12:35:24	tangentstorm	i see that. cool.
2012-12-10 12:35:47	tangentstorm	huh
2012-12-10 12:36:05	carefish	and it's still in refactoring-mode
2012-12-10 12:36:05	tangentstorm	have you already designed the game engine?
2012-12-10 12:36:10	carefish	yes
2012-12-10 12:36:28	carefish	now only making callbacks work in javascript
2012-12-10 12:36:29	carefish	which is a pain, and lots of typing
2012-12-10 12:36:48	tangentstorm	what does your engine do?
2012-12-10 12:37:09	carefish	what do you mean?
2012-12-10 12:37:30	tangentstorm	well for this project i have a game engine written in java that compiles to javacript through processing.js
2012-12-10 12:37:30	carefish	it's built w/ game creation as a main purpose
2012-12-10 12:37:35	tangentstorm	http://www.gamesketchlib.org/
2012-12-10 12:37:46	carefish	but it's also so i can easily make applications
2012-12-10 12:37:47	Diablodoct0r	Looking back at it, that IP Checker I made isn't so badly designed visually
2012-12-10 12:37:59	Diablodoct0r	http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/4/9200442874-orig.jpg
2012-12-10 12:38:16	Diablodoct0r	I was gonna make Cloud support and shit for it
2012-12-10 12:38:19	tangentstorm	Diablodoct0r: i'd say that looks pretty nice
2012-12-10 12:38:29	Diablodoct0r	thanks :3
2012-12-10 12:38:33	Diablodoct0r	I was gonna go full out on it, so I added lots of visual themes
2012-12-10 12:38:59	Diablodoct0r	And was gonna make Cloud support for storing your settings, and easter eggs, and lots of extras
2012-12-10 12:39:02	Diablodoct0r	Just to show how much fun you can have taking things to the max

2012-12-10 12:39:46	carefish	oh, and the other reason why i choose javascript over lua/python whatever
2012-12-10 12:40:00	carefish	the artists i have to work with use flash, and flash cs6 exports a nice spritesheet w/ javascript files
2012-12-10 12:40:08	tangentstorm	carefish: the vm i'm using is a tiny 30-instruction thing that has implementations in a bunch of different languages already... my plan had been to port gamesketchlib to native code via pascal

2012-12-10 15:39:00	tangentstorm	what happens when you try?

2012-12-10 15:39:58	carefish	it's always because de javascript engine can't parse it properly to C

2012-12-10 20:46:09	@intothev01d	hello
2012-12-10 20:48:28	FRodrigues	do you know any good books to learn SQL or in particular postgreSQL
2012-12-10 20:48:28	FRodrigues	?
2012-12-10 20:49:28	--	tangentafk is now known as tangentstorm
2012-12-10 20:50:14	@intothev01d	sql, I just took a database class, and I'm not sure of a particularly great book, just the one I had for the class. here's a whole list though for postgres (which probably some involve basic sql) http://www.postgresql.org/docs/books/
2012-12-10 20:52:23	FRodrigues	ty
2012-12-10 20:55:35	FRodrigues	maybe you can help me
2012-12-10 20:56:35	FRodrigues	how can I see if there's a person in a table?
2012-12-10 20:59:30	FRodrigues	personName = ( SELECT t.name FROM table t) ?
2012-12-10 21:00:46	@intothev01d	select * from table t will return anything in the table
2012-12-10 21:00:56	FRodrigues	I want to make a constraint that sees if theres a person with a specific name
2012-12-10 21:00:56	@intothev01d	like all rows
2012-12-10 21:01:01	@intothev01d	oh ok
2012-12-10 21:01:39	@intothev01d	select t.name from tablename t where t.name = 'name you want to check for'
2012-12-10 21:01:56	@intothev01d	that will show you the name if it's in the table
2012-12-10 21:02:06	FRodrigues	and it gives me a true or false?
2012-12-10 21:02:06	@intothev01d	no it gives you the name
2012-12-10 21:02:44	FRodrigues	but i want to make it a true or false statement
2012-12-10 21:02:56	@chance_z	then make it into one
2012-12-10 21:02:56	FRodrigues	for a check
2012-12-10 21:03:26	@chance_z	sql is a language for getting data, and inserting data
2012-12-10 21:03:26	@chance_z	that is all
2012-12-10 21:03:41	@chance_z	the rest is just different ways to get and insert data
2012-12-10 21:03:56	@chance_z	well i suppose removing data is in there, but w/e
2012-12-10 21:04:02	FRodrigues	check ('name' = (select t.name from tablename t where t.name = 'name you want to check for')
2012-12-10 21:04:12	FRodrigues	is this redundant?
2012-12-10 21:04:41	@chance_z	i would write a query
2012-12-10 21:04:41	@chance_z	to get a specified result
2012-12-10 21:04:41	@chance_z	and then just use that
2012-12-10 21:04:41	@chance_z	you can check if the result returned data, no need to write a 'check'
2012-12-10 21:04:47	@intothev01d	if you get a result, it will be true, no result will be false
2012-12-10 21:04:52	@chance_z	you can just if getUser("Bob") { };
2012-12-10 21:05:58	@intothev01d	you're surely not taking direct input from the user and passing it to the table are you?
2012-12-10 21:06:01	FRodrigues	no
2012-12-10 21:06:08	@intothev01d	it's ok if you did, i've done it before i knew better, but yea that's extremely bad
2012-12-10 21:06:56	@intothev01d	k
2012-12-10 21:06:56	FRodrigues	this isn't for a website
2012-12-10 21:07:12	@chance_z	doesnt mean you shouldnt sanatize input :)
2012-12-10 21:07:12	FRodrigues	or a project
2012-12-10 21:07:12	FRodrigues	this is for training
2012-12-10 21:07:30	@chance_z	the point still stands
2012-12-10 21:07:30	@intothev01d	yea def
2012-12-10 21:07:30	@chance_z	writing good code always is the best way to write code :)
2012-12-10 21:07:35	@intothev01d	even for training, better to learn the right way
2012-12-10 21:07:52	@chance_z	practice makes perfect, and it make sure you dont forget the ideas
2012-12-10 21:08:02	@chance_z	and it also helps you remember the process to 'do' what your training for
2012-12-10 21:08:06	@chance_z	the whole process.
2012-12-10 21:08:15	FRodrigues	I just want to make a create table script with some constraints
2012-12-10 21:08:32	FRodrigues	lol
2012-12-10 21:08:35	@intothev01d	ok… well then make it :D
2012-12-10 21:08:51	@chance_z	if your learning just sql, then just use sql, no need for a language other than sql
2012-12-10 21:09:13	FRodrigues	yes
2012-12-10 21:09:13	@intothev01d	i agree with that. adding the other layer could confuse you more really
2012-12-10 21:09:56		[Z_Mass back: gone 07:16:45]
2012-12-10 21:10:19	@intothev01d	just go to town making your own tables, queries, views etc right in the rdbms until you're comfortable with it
2012-12-10 21:10:31	@chance_z	thats the proper design process anyways
2012-12-10 21:11:06	@chance_z	decide what your inputs are, then write your queries based on those inputs, then write the functions in your programming language after you write the queries.
2012-12-10 21:12:11	@chance_z	otherwise you end up re-write a ton of code over and over, because you didnt specify the way it will be done before hand
2012-12-10 21:13:17	FRodrigues	i want to make this

2012-12-11 15:26:36	Phenax	If a real number is 47.5, it's floor will be 47, thus "there is a decimal"
2012-12-11 15:26:53	Phenax	If a real number is 47.0, it's floor will be 47.0, thus if they are equal "there is not a decimal"
2012-12-11 15:27:25	Phenax	casting to an integer is equivalent to flooring in most languages, so that's a shortcut, although most standard/math libraries include a floor function
2012-12-11 15:27:33	carefish	thanks phenax <3
2012-12-11 15:27:58	carefish	i also like reading math.floor better than (int)
2012-12-11 15:28:58	Phenax	Actually
2012-12-11 15:29:15	Phenax	casting to an int will truncate toward 0, my bad

2012-12-11 15:29:27	Phenax	It's to due with the IEEE-754 standard
2012-12-11 15:29:46	Phenax	However both still work for the application I believe
2012-12-11 15:30:45	carefish	oh, heh, i didn't know about that difference between floor and int
2012-12-11 15:30:45	Phenax	as (int)-2 = -2, and floor(-2) = -2
2012-12-11 15:31:30	carefish	the person who taught me C# told me it's generally not a good idea to 'just cast it'
2012-12-11 15:31:45	Phenax	Very true, the flooring would be a much more explanatory and defined move.
2012-12-11 15:31:59	carefish	better to use the appropriate math function (if math were to be required)
2012-12-11 15:32:10	Phenax	the int casting could possibly be redefined by a language, and also, just looking at the code it might not be obvious what you are doing
2012-12-11 15:32:30	p4r4d0x42	leaves less to chance that way
2012-12-11 15:32:30	carefish	yeah, the obvious part is what i like
2012-12-11 15:35:05	Phenax	Take into account that
2012-12-11 15:35:28	Phenax	there are some inaccuracies that actually could make that not check out correctly, for example
2012-12-11 15:35:32	Phenax	double a = hugeNum / hugeNum2;
2012-12-11 15:35:39	Phenax	might evaluate to 27.0000000000000000000000001
2012-12-11 15:35:49	Phenax	Even if it is really 27
2012-12-11 15:36:07	Phenax	Binary can't represent everything that base 10 can with the same accuracy
2012-12-11 15:36:07	Phenax	some base 10 number are infinitely repeating binary decimals
2012-12-11 15:36:44	Phenax	So if you wanted to know if the result of a/b is a decimal or not
2012-12-11 15:36:53	Phenax	if(a%b == 0) { then a/b is an integer }
2012-12-11 15:37:07	Phenax	Not sure if your division example is what you're going for here
2012-12-11 15:37:26	Phenax	But if it is, then that is a better solution
2012-12-11 15:38:56	Phenax	carefish: If you want an example of this, go to http://repl.it/
2012-12-11 15:39:00	Phenax	Choose some programming language like Python
2012-12-11 15:39:06	Phenax	and enter float(10.0 - 9.2)
2012-12-11 15:39:26	Phenax	=> 0.80000000000000071
2012-12-11 15:40:48	Phenax	double is of course more accurate, but it's just *more* accurate, not completely so
2012-12-11 15:42:03	tangentstorm	hmm
2012-12-11 15:42:39	Phenax	Some years ago I had a course all about this stuff - was pretty interesting
2012-12-11 15:43:05	tangentstorm	i'm trying to imagine a base 2 number that results in a repeating base 10 number.
2012-12-11 15:43:25	tangentstorm	rough hypothesis: it's not possible, because 2 is a factor of 10
2012-12-11 15:44:10	tangentstorm	(that is, a non-repeating base 2 fraction)
2012-12-11 15:44:58	carefish	i wish i was on a decent programming school :(
2012-12-11 15:45:25	Phenax	tangentstorm: Well, real numbers specifically
2012-12-11 15:45:27	Phenax	tangentstorm: Try 0.310
2012-12-11 15:45:31	Phenax	err
2012-12-11 15:45:41	Phenax	0.3_10
2012-12-11 15:45:51	Phenax	=> 0.0100110011001...
2012-12-11 15:45:51	Phenax	_2
2012-12-11 15:46:25	Phenax	http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.3+to+base+2
2012-12-11 15:47:01	carefish	thanks Phenax :)
2012-12-11 15:47:26	carefish	i really like your clear explanation :P

2012-12-12 14:09:49	tangentstorm	Yes.
2012-12-12 14:09:59	tangentstorm	Because you used .invokeLater()
2012-12-12 14:10:18	tangentstorm	it wasn't later enough yet when you got your null pointer exception.
2012-12-12 14:10:47	corlay	ok
2012-12-12 14:11:02	corlay	Thats the code which the UI builder made
2012-12-12 14:11:14	corlay	how can I chaneg that to work how I want it to work?
2012-12-12 14:11:16	tangentstorm	when you said 2d graphics.. do you mean you want to make guis with buttons and text and stuff? or do you want to make drawings and stuff?
2012-12-12 14:11:21	corlay	*change
2012-12-12 14:11:23	corlay	second
2012-12-12 14:11:36	tangentstorm	swing is all about the first
2012-12-12 14:11:40	corlay	I just started like 10 mins ago
2012-12-12 14:11:44	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-12 14:12:00	tangentstorm	have you ever programmed anything before?
2012-12-12 14:12:16	corlay	yup
2012-12-12 14:12:23	corlay	just was all text-based mostly
2012-12-12 14:12:33	tangentstorm	are you familiar with objects and stuff?
2012-12-12 14:12:37	corlay	yup
2012-12-12 14:12:39	tangentstorm	ok
2012-12-12 14:13:06	tangentstorm	well... i'd recommend downloading processing.org
2012-12-12 14:13:21	corlay	Ive bought a book and in it they introduce you to drawing stuff by drawing on JPanels
2012-12-12 14:13:23	corlay	ok
2012-12-12 14:13:29	tangentstorm	oh i see.
2012-12-12 14:13:46	tangentstorm	well, java2d does have a nice api, but processing is more fun :)
2012-12-12 14:14:14	tangentstorm	it's actually usable from plain old java if you want, but it'll also compile to javascript
2012-12-12 14:14:16	corlay	I dont really need some thing special, I just want to draw some boxes and circles and stuff
2012-12-12 14:14:57	tangentstorm	yeah... you can just open up processing and type    rectangle(10, 20, 100, 100); and it'll draw a rectangle
2012-12-12 14:15:20	tangentstorm	you *can* use classes and methods and all that if you want, but processing makes that all totally optional
2012-12-12 14:15:26	corlay	ok
2012-12-12 14:15:42	tangentstorm	it also adds some native syntax for colors so you can use rgba values
2012-12-12 14:15:59	corlay	I just wanted to get into Java because thats the language were using in school...
2012-12-12 14:16:40	tangentstorm	other than the two differences I just mentioned, it's exactly the same as java
2012-12-12 14:17:17	tangentstorm	you can even use it inside a swing application without invoking the processing pre-parser (that's what i do)
2012-12-12 14:17:26	corlay	ok
2012-12-12 14:17:44	corlay	Ill give it a shot
2012-12-12 14:17:48	tangentstorm	i made this for a video tutorial series i'm working on : http://gamesketchlib.org/
2012-12-12 14:18:17	tangentstorm	those are compiled to javascript, but they also run on android or as a standalone java app
2012-12-12 14:19:05	tangentstorm	there's some old videos at the bottom that i made for absolute beginners but if you already know objects they're probably not terribly useful
2012-12-12 14:19:49	tangentstorm	http://www.openprocessing.org/  <- community with a ton of cool looking processing graphics with source
2012-12-12 14:20:45	corlay	Looks very useful, thanks :)
2012-12-12 14:20:50	tangentstorm	have fun
2012-12-12 14:21:13	corlay	But aside that: How can I fix my problem with pure java?
2012-12-12 14:21:38	tangentstorm	put a delay in there that loops until f is not null.
2012-12-12 14:22:25	tangentstorm	possibly you can add a synchronized keyword around your second method...
2012-12-12 14:23:37	tangentstorm	nope. disregard that. just add a while (f != null) {}
2012-12-12 14:23:49	tangentstorm	er while (f==null){}
2012-12-12 14:25:32	corlay	Already tried that out... now my panel isnt drawn at all
2012-12-12 14:25:50	tangentstorm	Hrm.
2012-12-12 14:26:28	tangentstorm	Okay, it's been a long time since I used swing. Let's see.
2012-12-12 14:26:45	corlay	I always have problems with acessing things of my UI from outside
2012-12-12 14:27:06	tangentstorm	well my understanding is that there are two separate threads running
2012-12-12 14:27:11	tangentstorm	the swing thread and the main thread
2012-12-12 14:27:15	corlay	yup
2012-12-12 14:27:52	tangentstorm	it's very possible that the swing thread doesn't start until after your main routine exits
2012-12-12 14:28:39	tangentstorm	in which case you would expect to be able to provide a callback... probably a method called onCreate or something
2012-12-12 14:28:54	tangentstorm	and then you'd put your logic in there

2012-12-12 14:29:16	 *	tangentstorm pulls up an ancient swing app
2012-12-12 14:30:22	corlay	it still doesnt work if I put   f.movePanel();   into the initFrame()
2012-12-12 14:30:23	tangentstorm	this is why i like processing if i just want to draw. it completely hides all the annoying "java" stuff you don't need
2012-12-12 14:31:02	corlay	does it also generate methods for accessing all the drawn stuff?
2012-12-12 14:31:13	tangentstorm	where did you put it?
2012-12-12 14:31:30	tangentstorm	on line 18 your comment says it works
2012-12-12 14:32:11	corlay	http://bpaste.net/show/IsfGjbWKuo2wPLao67ft/
2012-12-12 14:32:12	tangentstorm	you can also put this.movePanel() in the initGUI()
2012-12-12 14:32:16	corlay	thats how I have it now
2012-12-12 14:32:24	corlay	thats what I did
2012-12-12 14:32:32	corlay	still doenst work
2012-12-12 14:32:39	corlay	worked before putting in the loop
2012-12-12 14:33:01	tangentstorm	okay but you still have the loop there
2012-12-12 14:33:21	corlay	if I delete the loop then Im at the same point where I started
2012-12-12 14:33:33	tangentstorm	first, just to double check: with the loop there, it just does nothing, right?
2012-12-12 14:33:46	corlay	empty JFrame
2012-12-12 14:33:48	corlay	without the panel
2012-12-12 14:34:41	corlay	I just want to be able to use movePanel() more than just once in initFrame()
2012-12-12 14:35:05	corlay	its just there for testing
2012-12-12 14:36:17	tangentstorm	you want the panel to move around like it's animated?
2012-12-12 14:36:35	corlay	jup

2012-12-12 16:17:29	tangentstorm	well, you have until friday :)
2012-12-12 16:17:47	tangentstorm	but it comes around every few months
2012-12-12 16:20:52	carefish	do you have any comments on the UML?
2012-12-12 16:21:17	carefish	because some of that stuff isn't implemented yet, it's going to be though.

2012-12-12 16:24:33	tangentstorm	It makes sense... but there's not much there yet
2012-12-12 16:26:44	tangentstorm	It looks like you have three singletons or static classes... not really any objects... which is totally fine of course...
2012-12-12 16:26:48	carefish	oh, i'm not that experienced with uml
2012-12-12 16:26:49	tangentstorm	i just normally use uml diagrams when i'm showing how classes relate to each other.
2012-12-12 16:26:59	carefish	Core was going to be the namespace
2012-12-12 16:27:13	carefish	the class Core was going to tie it all together
2012-12-12 16:27:57	carefish	in V8Setup i create a new Assets, which derives from JavaScriptCore, and that initializes V8
2012-12-12 16:29:25	tangentstorm	carefish: okay, so look at http://i.imgur.com/4ieoD.png again
2012-12-12 16:29:47	tangentstorm	do you see the little triangle arrows?
2012-12-12 16:29:59	carefish	yeh?
2012-12-12 16:30:09	tangentstorm	uml really is a "language" with syntax and whatnot... it's just visual instead of textual
2012-12-12 16:30:31	tangentstorm	those arrows indicate subclassing
2012-12-12 16:30:51	carefish	gsbasic.gamecamera ?
2012-12-12 16:30:51	tangentstorm	so if "Assets" is a subclass of "JavascriptCore" then you should draw one of those arrows
2012-12-12 16:31:03	tangentstorm	each box like that is a class
2012-12-12 16:31:09	carefish	yeah
2012-12-12 16:31:12	tangentstorm	unless it says   <<interface>> above it
2012-12-12 16:31:42	tangentstorm	so GameCamera is a subclass of GsBasic
2012-12-12 16:31:47	tangentstorm	it really should be GsCamera
2012-12-12 16:33:01	tangentstorm	the interfaces floating above GsBasic are me taking liberties with the syntax because they're not really interfaces
2012-12-12 16:33:01	tangentstorm	but they probably should be :)
2012-12-12 16:33:46	tangentstorm	but in any case... what it's showing you is that GsBasic has all of the methods from all of those interfaces
2012-12-12 16:34:12	carefish	http://img.is1337.eu/60fa43d9.png like htis?
2012-12-12 16:34:28	tangentstorm	and if you look at GsContainer, you see there's another weird diamond thing, saying that gscontainer contains any nmuber of gsbasics

2012-12-12 16:35:41	tangentstorm	carefish: different kind of arrow, but that works :)  when you said "derives from javascriptcore" i thought you meant it was a subclass
2012-12-12 16:36:26	carefish	ehh, class Assets : public JavaScriptCore is what i have now in the header, that's what i meant :P
2012-12-12 16:36:47	tangentstorm	so assets contains one javascriptcore?
2012-12-12 16:38:35	carefish	i guess? :P
2012-12-12 16:38:47	carefish	i only make 1 new Assets in main

2012-12-12 16:40:04	carefish	well, i barely have any knowledge of software design
2012-12-12 16:40:04	tangentstorm	so objects are inherently concurrent... you have a bunch of them floating around in ram simultaneously, and they intereact in different ways.
2012-12-12 16:40:09	carefish	so i just make it up as i go, but i wouldn't mind some real decent advice :)
2012-12-12 16:40:20	tangentstorm	so... UML is sort of there to help you visualize what's going on
2012-12-12 16:40:26	carefish	yeah, i figured that
2012-12-12 16:40:42	tangentstorm	there are actually i think 12 types of diagrams or something?
2012-12-12 16:41:06	carefish	and because i realized this was gonna be quite a huge project, i figured: let's design it first, then make it
2012-12-12 16:41:51	tangentstorm	the two main ones i use are the class diagram (what i showed you, and what you're drawing), and the activity diagram, which shows how information flows through the system
2012-12-12 16:41:51	carefish	so if you've got any tips, please i'd love to learn :P
2012-12-12 16:41:51	tangentstorm	probably also the sequence diagram
2012-12-12 16:42:13	tangentstorm	the class diagram is specifically for showing static structure
2012-12-12 16:42:27	tangentstorm	the structure of how the classes relate to each other
2012-12-12 16:42:49	carefish	hmm
2012-12-12 16:42:49	tangentstorm	the other two i mentioned are about showing behavior
2012-12-12 16:43:17	tangentstorm	so like... in your game you're going to have a scene with a bunch of things in it
2012-12-12 16:43:27	carefish	so if i were to make a 'Render' class, it would also need an arrow from the javascriptcore (or derive from it)?
2012-12-12 16:44:12	tangentstorm	render is a weird name for a class
2012-12-12 16:44:13	carefish	is it?
2012-12-12 16:44:18	tangentstorm	class names should be nouns
2012-12-12 16:44:28	tangentstorm	method names should be verbs
2012-12-12 16:44:29	carefish	i was going to use it to render the fonts/sprites
2012-12-12 16:45:00	tangentstorm	so.. first of all, you probably want a Sprite class :)
2012-12-12 16:45:13	tangentstorm	and a Font class :)
2012-12-12 16:45:36	SageHand	@Tangentstorm. Context Models, Interaction Models, Structural Models and Behavioral Models are the basic distinctions between different model types under UML I believe.
2012-12-12 16:46:39	tangentstorm	SageHand : sounds about right
2012-12-12 16:46:40	carefish	aah, so each class loads it's own thing and then i combine those load()'s in assets which then gets inserted into the javascriptcore?
2012-12-12 16:47:07	carefish	(well, ehh.. i mean, inserted into the Assets class which then gets instantiated in main)
2012-12-12 16:47:37	tangentstorm	see I wouldn't call it Assets either
2012-12-12 16:47:37	tangentstorm	What you have is a list of Asset instances
2012-12-12 16:47:43	carefish	oh, well, what would be a smarter name?
2012-12-12 16:47:44	tangentstorm	or an AssetManager maybe
2012-12-12 16:48:17	carefish	hmm, that actually does make more sense
2012-12-12 16:49:02	tangentstorm	I'm not really trying to convince you that an object oriented is better than what you're doing... i'm just saying UML is really for communicating object-oriented designs
2012-12-12 16:49:04	tangentstorm	so if you use those symbols it *implies* an object oriented approach
2012-12-12 16:49:14	carefish	ah
2012-12-12 16:49:56	carefish	well, i am sad to say the school i'm at doesn't really teach programming, or course material about OOP/UML
2012-12-12 16:50:24	carefish	so i don't mind a lil' convincing here and there :P
2012-12-12 16:50:42	tangentstorm	no problem. i learned UML from a grouchy old hard-ass java developer i was working with, and he was a stickler for doing everything a certain way :)
2012-12-12 16:50:42	SageHand	I'm doing Software Engineering. We're doing nothing but fucking UML this semester.
2012-12-12 16:51:20	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-12 16:51:20	tangentstorm	I actually like UML
2012-12-12 16:51:42	carefish	i'm stuck at a public college :( the course is called 'Game Development', but it's barely that
2012-12-12 16:52:02	SageHand	its a nice tool but when you make at least a model a day it becomes tedious.
2012-12-12 16:52:17	tangentstorm	and strong type systems... i like to work out the structure of my ideas visually so i can see everything, then generate a shell of the code from the uml, and fill in tests and details as i go
2012-12-12 16:52:27	tangentstorm	ah yah... i don't use it 24/7
2012-12-12 16:52:38	carefish	hmm, that means i'd have to make a manager to handle all the callbacks too, right?
2012-12-12 16:52:38	tangentstorm	but i am a pretty visual thinker
2012-12-12 16:52:43	SageHand	its really good for documenting, and it will be easier to maintain code if you do it.
2012-12-12 16:53:33	tangentstorm	carefish: give me an example of a callback
2012-12-12 16:53:37	tangentstorm	in your system i mean.

2012-12-12 16:53:55	carefish	in the pic you see two 'different' callbacks
2012-12-12 16:54:06	carefish	javascriptcore has one, and assets has one
2012-12-12 16:54:24	carefish	they're both added to the globalscope in javascript
2012-12-12 16:54:57	carefish	so if i were to make a callbackmanager, it'd simply access the proper assetmanager loadcall
2012-12-12 16:55:25	carefish	or in Print()s case, access the print via the callbackmanager
2012-12-12 16:55:39	tangentstorm	but i mean what would you use a callback for in your system?
2012-12-12 16:55:51	carefish	the setup is that you can use javascript to make your game
2012-12-12 16:55:57	tangentstorm	right
2012-12-12 16:56:09	carefish	var a = new LoadSprite('something.png'); works already
2012-12-12 16:56:20	carefish	and atm gets drawn on the screen
2012-12-12 16:56:24	tangentstorm	okay. so what is stored in "a" ?
2012-12-12 16:56:42	carefish	A currently has the X/Y properties set in C++
2012-12-12 16:56:49	carefish	get/set from C++
2012-12-12 16:56:57	tangentstorm	properties of what?
2012-12-12 16:57:16	carefish	the image/sprite you just loaded
2012-12-12 16:57:43	tangentstorm	eventually you'd say  a.x = 5 or something, right?
2012-12-12 16:57:59	carefish	so better would be: var image = LoadSprite('ball1.png');
2012-12-12 16:58:00	carefish	yeah.
2012-12-12 16:58:00	tangentstorm	okay... now what if i want a second ball?
2012-12-12 16:58:04	carefish	it's going to change to something else though, something i liked about unity
2012-12-12 16:58:06	tangentstorm	load a second copy of the image?
2012-12-12 16:58:22	carefish	that's where the render part comes in

2012-12-12 16:58:55	carefish	you'd get two balls
2012-12-12 16:58:57	tangentstorm	so you're going to have a bunch of { x, y, pointer-to-img } structures in an array or something
2012-12-12 16:59:02	tangentstorm	or list or whatever
2012-12-12 16:59:12	carefish	it's stored in an std::vector now
2012-12-12 16:59:33	tangentstorm	ok
2012-12-12 16:59:50	tangentstorm	is this strictly 2d?
2012-12-12 16:59:52	carefish	no
2012-12-12 17:00:01	carefish	eventually i'll add 3d
2012-12-12 17:00:05	carefish	but first i wanted to have 2d working perfectly
2012-12-12 17:00:13	carefish	in stages though
2012-12-12 17:00:34	tangentstorm	ok, but it's probably 2.5d, because you want some overlap to the objects, right?
2012-12-12 17:00:57	carefish	first part: loading assets second part: drawing/playing assets (sprites/fonts and audio) third part: moving stuff around
2012-12-12 17:01:02	tangentstorm	like you probably want your score and stuff to be floating around on top no matter how everything else goes
2012-12-12 17:01:09	carefish	already got taht solved
2012-12-12 17:01:31	carefish	what gets inserted first will be 'top'-later

2012-12-12 17:10:53	carefish	add the right event handlers to the buttons which are also made in javascript

2012-12-12 17:11:29	carefish	the point of this game engine is to have a .exe that can run javascript

2012-12-12 17:13:34	carefish	i might've gotten my terminology wrong there
2012-12-12 17:13:40	tangentstorm	i think that's a great idea.. it's just not a game engine
2012-12-12 17:14:02	carefish	all the rendering/loading of actual assets gets done in C++ though
2012-12-12 17:14:12	carefish	javascript just calls the proper C++ functions
2012-12-12 17:14:34	tangentstorm	yeah.. so what you're making is sort of like the canvas drawing target in a web browser, with only the text and image parts
2012-12-12 17:15:01	carefish	and audio, and making stuff move yea
2012-12-12 17:15:09	tangentstorm	ok
2012-12-12 17:15:21	carefish	eventually i'll add stuff like physics
2012-12-12 17:15:25	<--	qulinxao (~qulinxao@v-853923.vpn.mgn.ru) has quit (Quit: Ухожу я от вас (xchat 2.4.5 или старше))
2012-12-12 17:15:38	carefish	(going to look at box2d, jiglib, and google around for others)
2012-12-12 17:15:49	tangentstorm	so what you'll see if you google javascript game engines is that canvas is really low level, and what everybody does is build a game engine on top of it
2012-12-12 17:16:06	carefish	heh, okay? :P
2012-12-12 17:16:07	tangentstorm	just like flash isn't a game engine
2012-12-12 17:16:16	carefish	ah ok
2012-12-12 17:16:24	tangentstorm	you're making something like the flash stage, but for bitmaps rather than vectors
2012-12-12 17:16:25	carefish	so i'm building a framework for an engine?
2012-12-12 17:16:59	carefish	well, bitmaps, any fileformat really, but for now .png will suffice
2012-12-12 17:17:04	tangentstorm	well, let me continue my argument then, even though i now see it's not what you're trying to do.. it'll show you the kind of thing that goes into the "game" part :)
2012-12-12 17:17:44	tangentstorm	so imagine a flowchart for a simple arcade game
2012-12-12 17:18:11	carefish	insertcoin->press play button->win/lose game->retry?
2012-12-12 17:18:17	tangentstorm	you load up the game, get an intro screen (then 17000 other intro screens) and then ... yea
2012-12-12 17:18:35	tangentstorm	and usually in an actual arcade there's an "attract mode" where it shows a demo
2012-12-12 17:18:42	tangentstorm	and the high scores
2012-12-12 17:18:47	carefish	yeah
2012-12-12 17:18:50	tangentstorm	and it cycles between those and the start screen
2012-12-12 17:19:05	tangentstorm	and on a *console* game, there's usually pause, and maybe something between levels
2012-12-12 17:19:24	tangentstorm	maybe a shop where you can buy upgrades
2012-12-12 17:19:51	tangentstorm	and of course different levels
2012-12-12 17:19:57	tangentstorm	or rooms
2012-12-12 17:19:58	tangentstorm	 or whatever
2012-12-12 17:20:27	carefish	yeah, okay?
2012-12-12 17:20:27	tangentstorm	so what you have is a bunch of states that are collections of sprites that are used for each of those states
2012-12-12 17:20:38	tangentstorm	that made no sense. let me rephrase :)
2012-12-12 17:21:14	tangentstorm	you can think of each of these screens  as an object representing one state or mode of interaction.
2012-12-12 17:21:39	carefish	well, i can create that in javascript right?
2012-12-12 17:21:45	tangentstorm	and each one has its own scene graph
2012-12-12 17:21:54	carefish	make a statemanager in javascript i mean
2012-12-12 17:21:54	tangentstorm	like each one is laid out differently
2012-12-12 17:21:56	tangentstorm	sure
2012-12-12 17:22:33	tangentstorm	but like that hud is probably not going to appear on the menu screen
2012-12-12 17:23:01	tangentstorm	and if you have a separate map screen, then everything goes away... and then when you leave the map, the normal stuff comes back
2012-12-12 17:23:04	carefish	nope, but then i'd simply clear the font/spritelist and reload it w/ the proper screen
2012-12-12 17:23:09	tangentstorm	that's why you want to bundle it into an object
2012-12-12 17:23:14	tangentstorm	yeah
2012-12-12 17:23:45	tangentstorm	but if you hit pause and then want to come back... where do you store all that stuff in the meantime?
2012-12-12 17:23:52	tangentstorm	or between levels?
2012-12-12 17:24:13	carefish	pause i'd stop the draw updates
2012-12-12 17:24:25	carefish	in between levels i think i'd do something similar?
2012-12-12 17:24:39	tangentstorm	but you'd still be drawing other things
2012-12-12 17:24:48	carefish	stop/store them in a pauselist and fill the spritelist w/ pause hud/whatever
2012-12-12 17:24:49	tangentstorm	like the pause screen
2012-12-12 17:25:32	tangentstorm	yeah, you get what i'm saying... you're going to want to store those lists and swap them out
2012-12-12 17:25:38	carefish	yeah
2012-12-12 17:25:45	tangentstorm	put some of them aside, bring them back later, etc
2012-12-12 17:25:49	carefish	so i'm missing a few lists
2012-12-12 17:26:01	carefish	well, the ability to create more from javascript to be precise
2012-12-12 17:26:06	-->	HelloComputer15 (~Warrick@174-24-219-6.tukw.qwest.net) has joined #learnprogramming
2012-12-12 17:26:25	tangentstorm	you could totally do this with javascript arrays, and just loop through the items in the array and draw those
2012-12-12 17:26:53	carefish	true, but i think std::vector has better memory management than a javascript array
2012-12-12 17:26:58	tangentstorm	that would be starting to build a game engine atop what you're providing
2012-12-12 17:27:07	tangentstorm	very probably :)
2012-12-12 17:27:11	@NoaHall	What are you working on?
2012-12-12 17:27:39	carefish	uhh.. well it's not a game engine, so i guess i'm working on a framework for a game engine? :P
2012-12-12 17:27:51	carefish	(application engine/application framework)
2012-12-12 17:27:54	tangentstorm	hey NoaHall ... carefish is making a tool for making games in javascript
2012-12-12 17:28:02	tangentstorm	but outside of a browser
2012-12-12 17:28:17	@NoaHall	So like... Unity? :D
2012-12-12 17:28:22	tangentstorm	more like pygame
2012-12-12 17:28:34	@NoaHall	Ahh, cool
2012-12-12 17:28:36	carefish	like unity NoaHall
2012-12-12 17:28:43	tangentstorm	more like unity. duh.
2012-12-12 17:28:45	carefish	i got a few people interested in making an IDE for it
2012-12-12 17:29:04	@NoaHall	I've actually been contracted to make a game in Unity, so I've been playing with it a lot recently
2012-12-12 17:29:13	tangentstorm	oh nice :)
2012-12-12 17:29:16	carefish	i get 'lessons' in unity, lawl.
2012-12-12 17:29:17	tangentstorm	i like it a lot
2012-12-12 17:29:22	carefish	batshitinsane easy w/ unity
2012-12-12 17:29:28	@NoaHall	It's pretty good at some things, a horrible pain to do other things and the documentation isn't great in places
2012-12-12 17:29:54	carefish	i've already had to send 3 bug/crashreports xD
2012-12-12 17:29:57	@NoaHall	But overall, I'd say it's probably the best place to get making games if you don't want to mess around with all the grizzly bits
2012-12-12 17:30:09	@NoaHall	No Linux support too :(
2012-12-12 17:30:11	carefish	but i don't like unity's way
2012-12-12 17:30:20	carefish	my framework will work on anything
2012-12-12 17:30:24	carefish	a recompile away
2012-12-12 17:30:25	@NoaHall	Hawt :)
2012-12-12 17:30:38	tangentstorm	i made the code for this in unity: http://alchementrix.com/wordpress/?page_id=284
2012-12-12 17:30:45	@NoaHall	What stage are you at? Design?
2012-12-12 17:31:04	carefish	me?
2012-12-12 17:31:30	tangentstorm	yeah i think he meant you :)
2012-12-12 17:31:36	carefish	well, i've started off like 5 days ago, and i realised yesterday it's far too big of a project to just 'do', without a bit of thinking ahead
2012-12-12 17:32:01	tangentstorm	carefish: you may also want to look at this: http://www.haxenme.org/
2012-12-12 17:32:17	tangentstorm	it's also competing in that "target everything" space
2012-12-12 17:32:31	carefish	hah
2012-12-12 17:32:39	carefish	too bad it probably can't beat javascript
2012-12-12 17:32:48	tangentstorm	?
2012-12-12 17:33:10	tangentstorm	beat it at what?
2012-12-12 17:33:28	carefish	i mean, uhh.. javascript gets used alot more in the gaming industry, esp. right now w/ unity on the rise
2012-12-12 17:33:38	carefish	(okay, unityscript.. whatever)
2012-12-12 17:33:41	@NoaHall	carefish: Ahhh, cool. A plan is definitely needed for it, it's a big project, hehe :D
2012-12-12 17:33:41	tangentstorm	oh. i used c#
2012-12-12 17:33:49	carefish	me too
2012-12-12 17:34:06	carefish	but i know a few game studios who used unityscript
2012-12-12 17:34:28	tangentstorm	i would think lua is the scripting language of choice traditionally in the game industry... though you're probably right about js catching up
2012-12-12 17:34:41	carefish	lua is too slow for what i want to do
2012-12-12 17:35:00	carefish	lua is stringconversion back'n'forth if i read right
2012-12-12 17:35:03	@NoaHall	XD
2012-12-12 17:35:04	tangentstorm	though if you look on the freelance boards... corona and unity are pretty much what's in the most demand.. because of mobile games
2012-12-12 17:35:17	carefish	and the javascript engine i'm using compiles javascript to machine code
2012-12-12 17:35:27	tangentstorm	corona = wildly popular lua -> native compiler
2012-12-12 17:35:34	tangentstorm	commercial
2012-12-12 17:35:35	carefish	hmm
2012-12-12 17:35:41	carefish	okay :)
2012-12-12 17:35:43	carefish	so i've got competitors
2012-12-12 17:35:45	carefish	so what? :P
2012-12-12 17:36:10	tangentstorm	so you asked me for advice
2012-12-12 17:36:12	@NoaHall	Personally, I would rather Lua over Javascript, but then I would rather Python over Lua
2012-12-12 17:36:27	tangentstorm	my advice is to learn from all the other tools out there
2012-12-12 17:36:29	carefish	i didn't really enjoy lua's syntax
2012-12-12 17:36:53	@NoaHall	And you do enjoy Javascript's? :P
2012-12-12 17:36:53	tangentstorm	haxe for example achieves part of its cross platform magic by compiling the source to other things
2012-12-12 17:37:02	tangentstorm	it compiles to javascript, for example
2012-12-12 17:37:23	carefish	i prefer C++ at the moment, but javascript is easier to explain to game artists who've used action script 3 before
2012-12-12 17:37:25	tangentstorm	haxe also compiles to actionscript.
2012-12-12 17:37:33	tangentstorm	and c++
2012-12-12 17:37:35	carefish	and most game artists i've worked with know a teensy bit of actionscript
2012-12-12 17:38:03	carefish	i'll get around to implementing haxe tangentstorm, seems promising
2012-12-12 17:38:04	tangentstorm	in fact... haxe started as an actionscript 3 compiler
2012-12-12 17:38:33	carefish	and the other thing that made me chose javascript over lua/python: most programmers can do javascript
2012-12-12 17:38:53	@NoaHall	Hmmm
2012-12-12 17:38:53	@NoaHall	I disagree
2012-12-12 17:39:06	carefish	ehh, i mean: "know" javascript, from the people i've asked at a game conference here
2012-12-12 17:39:09	@NoaHall	Most people can use javascript up until they have to make classes
2012-12-12 17:39:11	tangentstorm	most programmers also kind of hate javascript :)
2012-12-12 17:39:18	carefish	yup :D
2012-12-12 17:39:18	@NoaHall	prototypes, rather :P
2012-12-12 17:39:27	carefish	another reason i liked it tangentstorm
2012-12-12 17:39:38	carefish	i don't want programmers to feel at ease using this frame work
2012-12-12 17:39:39	tangentstorm	http://javascriptgamer.com/brickslayer/
2012-12-12 17:39:43	carefish	just like you feel when using unity
2012-12-12 17:40:03	carefish	hawt and exciting but dirty at the same time
2012-12-12 17:40:09	@NoaHall	hahah
2012-12-12 17:40:47	tangentstorm	carefish: the same ideas apply no matter what language you're using
2012-12-12 17:41:24	tangentstorm	you can learn from pygame even though it uses a different language. it's still C under the hood
2012-12-12 17:41:35	tangentstorm	and it's still doing a lot of similar things to what you're doing
2012-12-12 17:41:44	tangentstorm	same with allegro...
2012-12-12 17:42:02	tangentstorm	zengl is also cross platform ( with no c/c++ under the hood )

2012-12-12 17:44:54	carefish	Enalicho, i like the prototype thingy of javascript :)
2012-12-12 17:45:17	tangentstorm	ok... i guess i was coming off kind of critical there... sorry. :)
2012-12-12 17:45:35	@Enalicho	Hmmm
2012-12-12 17:45:39	carefish	heh, i do get what you're saying though, i think :p
2012-12-12 17:45:39	@Enalicho	Fair enough
2012-12-12 17:46:04	tangentstorm	all i was going to show you is that instead of a flat list, a lot of game engines use some kind of tree structure, or nested lists
2012-12-12 17:46:16	carefish	it'll be a great learning experience, and experience in C++ is what i'm lacking (started like 6 months ago) so yeah xD
2012-12-12 17:46:27	carefish	ahh
2012-12-12 17:46:58	tangentstorm	which gets reused by the physics engine, the rendering engine, the screenflow/console-state-management system...
2012-12-12 17:47:12	carefish	ah :)
2012-12-12 17:47:32	tangentstorm	like in flixel, you can use a FlxGroup for each layer
2012-12-12 17:47:48	tangentstorm	and also for each type of enemy
2012-12-12 17:48:00	carefish	oh, so it'd be a wise idea to not just load the sprites, but assign a 'list' too?
2012-12-12 17:48:02	tangentstorm	so if you want to loop through all the enemies, you use a flxgroup for that
2012-12-12 17:48:33	tangentstorm	hmmm
2012-12-12 17:48:49	carefish	example: var a = sprite('bla', aList) var b = sprite(bleep, bList) var c = sprite(c, aList) ?
2012-12-12 17:49:16	carefish	and those lists will be added in the main list that get's rendered?
2012-12-12 17:49:24	tangentstorm	well in this pattern, a sprite can belong to many lists at once
2012-12-12 17:49:37	carefish	hmm
2012-12-12 17:49:42	carefish	how would i manage that?
2012-12-12 17:49:58	tangentstorm	http://i.imgur.com/4ieoD.png
2012-12-12 17:50:14	tangentstorm	i would show you a diagram for flixel but i don't have one. i just looked at flixel and drew this :)
2012-12-12 17:50:35	tangentstorm	so.. GsGroup is my version of FlxGroup
2012-12-12 17:50:57	<--	Diablodoct0r (~bdyddoc@ti0140a380-dhcp1205.bb.online.no) has quit (Quit: I am the definition of eclectic)
2012-12-12 17:51:07	tangentstorm	if you follow the arrows, you'll see that GsGroup is-a GsContainer which is-a GsBasic
2012-12-12 17:51:40	carefish	gsbasic being?
2012-12-12 17:51:57	tangentstorm	GsBasic is just a root object that provides these interfaces
2012-12-12 17:52:06	tangentstorm	i know it's crazy but the camera has hit points
2012-12-12 17:52:11	tangentstorm	in flixel
2012-12-12 17:52:30	tangentstorm	it's kind of silly from an OO design point of view but it really simplifies things
2012-12-12 17:52:48	tangentstorm	when dealing with a static type system i mean
2012-12-12 17:52:55	carefish	haha
2012-12-12 17:53:08	carefish	well, in my previous games walls had hitpoints too
2012-12-12 17:53:51	tangentstorm	so GsBasic is just an abstract class that implements Nullable, GridMember, Interactive, Playable, and Spatial
2012-12-12 17:53:51	carefish	let's see if i can have this piece of software generate a diagram from that project
2012-12-12 17:54:08	carefish	don't laugh though, probably looks silly xD
2012-12-12 17:54:31	tangentstorm	ok :)
2012-12-12 17:55:05	tangentstorm	so... the thing is GsGroups contain GsBasics and they -are- GsBasics
2012-12-12 17:55:09	tangentstorm	which means you can nest them
2012-12-12 17:55:38	tangentstorm	or... you can take all of the items on one layer and shift them one pixel to the right, for a parallax effect
2012-12-12 17:55:53	tangentstorm	well, you can with FlxLayer . i didn't implement that :)
2012-12-12 17:56:10	tangentstorm	FlxLayer is just another subclass of FlxGroup
2012-12-12 17:57:53	tangentstorm	for collision detection, you want something like this too, because you don't want to test collisions between every pair of objects (because you're dealing with n^2 comparisons, and that gets really slow really fast)
2012-12-12 17:58:27	tangentstorm	so bottom line: one thing you want in a game engine is a special purpose nestable container that can do this kind of thing
2012-12-12 17:59:11	tangentstorm	( in unity this would be GameObject, though it uses a much more component oriented approach )
2012-12-12 18:00:25	carefish	grmbl, this uml software doesn't make those arrows
2012-12-12 18:01:33	SageHand	how do you decide what objects to test collision against then.
2012-12-12 18:03:06	tangentstorm	carefish: !??! that sounds like "this java compiler doesn't allow the equal sign" to me :)
2012-12-12 18:03:28	tangentstorm	SageHand: well, several ways
2012-12-12 18:03:32	tangentstorm	first, you want to localalize checks to the surrounding area
2012-12-12 18:03:51	tangentstorm	so you use a quadtree in a 2d game or an octree in a 3d game
2012-12-12 18:04:27	tangentstorm	imagine drawing a big plus sign over the 2d plane ( 4 quadrants ) and then subdividing those into 4 , and so on... that's a quadtree
2012-12-12 18:05:13	tangentstorm	octree is the same but divides a cube into 8 subcubes
2012-12-12 18:05:34	tangentstorm	the other way is to check collisions only against groups of objects
2012-12-12 18:05:58	tangentstorm	so a mario style game might have a Group of coins for example...
2012-12-12 18:06:19	tangentstorm	you do collide(mario, coins)  so you're only checking the one object (mario) vs the coins
2012-12-12 18:06:25	carefish	wow, last time i used software ideas modeler it drew those lines as well... now it doesn't :(
2012-12-12 18:06:33	tangentstorm	carefish: check the diagram type
2012-12-12 18:06:36	SageHand	I suppose there isn't an easy way to check only when two objects come within proximity of each other since you would have to constantly check positions then.

2012-12-12 18:08:03	tangentstorm	SageHand: yes, a physics engine does constantly check positions of all objects. but it arranges them in a quad/oct-tree to make the number of comparisions as small as possible
2012-12-12 18:08:27	tangentstorm	because you're only going to collide with things that are in your region
2012-12-12 18:08:52	tangentstorm	( of course when you move fast enough that you span multiple regions in the tree, you have to account for that too )
2012-12-12 18:08:53	carefish	gimme a sec, gonna resize some bits, and gonna see if i can fix a screenshot

2012-12-12 18:10:09	tangentstorm	SageHand: if you watch a visualization of a physics engine, there's also usually a feature that figures out when objects have stopped moving, and then they don't get checked anymore either, unless something collides with them and they have to start moving again )
2012-12-12 18:10:17	tangentstorm	lemme find an example
2012-12-12 18:11:51	tangentstorm	http://box2dflash.sourceforge.net/
2012-12-12 18:12:29	tangentstorm	the ragdolss turn red when their velocity and accelleration both drop to 0

2012-12-12 18:13:52	carefish	couldn't find a way to make one .png
2012-12-12 18:13:57	SageHand	so if no object has any velocity or accelleration in a quadrant you stop checking collision in that quad?
2012-12-12 18:14:09	tangentstorm	SageHand: probably
2012-12-12 18:14:14	tangentstorm	that's the other nice thing about trees
2012-12-12 18:14:25	tangentstorm	you can mark the entire subtree as being inactive
2012-12-12 18:14:44	SageHand	pretty smart
2012-12-12 18:14:59	tangentstorm	or: invisible, etc.
2012-12-12 18:15:36	carefish	those pics are the uml generated from the project
2012-12-12 18:15:39	tangentstorm	and then when you're looping through your "update" list, calling your "tick" or "step" or "draw" function on each object, you can skip over the entire group there
2012-12-12 18:15:46	SageHand	currently am following a tutorial on 2d-game engine coding in java on youtube. So far I've gotten around to adding entities to a level in a list and of course making the entire render logic.
2012-12-12 18:16:07	tangentstorm	carefish: looking at them now
2012-12-12 18:16:08	carefish	too bad it didn't draw all the arrows
2012-12-12 18:16:08	Phenax	These UML diagrams remind me of school, ugh :<

2012-12-12 18:17:46	tangentstorm	microsoft c# tool for making xbox indie games
2012-12-12 18:17:55	tangentstorm	and windows games too
2012-12-12 18:18:01	carefish	not just xbox, winphone/win too
2012-12-12 18:18:03	tangentstorm	yep
2012-12-12 18:18:37	tangentstorm	it's actually pretty nice. you can put a game on the indy store in xbox live with only peer review
2012-12-12 18:18:57	tangentstorm	no microsoft screening / licensing... there is a $99 fee, but that's it

2012-12-12 23:37:48	SageHand	You will need to write a method for accessing it's values then call that method from the other classfile.
2012-12-12 23:39:00	ouch	the array is in this method. So how to write the getter method using that array. The array is a local
2012-12-12 23:39:38	ouch	http://pastebin.com/rwuVbNJV
2012-12-12 23:39:46	ouch	getter for userSelection array, right?
2012-12-12 23:39:57	ouch	but I don't know how to access it from the method itself
2012-12-12 23:40:35	SageHand	I would make it class-wide instead of having it inside the method then.
2012-12-12 23:41:36	ouch	I tried it first but I couldn't assign the userNumber values to the array
2012-12-12 23:41:43	SageHand	outside of the method have the code " int[] userSelection = new int[6];

2012-12-13 00:03:29	ouch	ignore my name
2012-12-13 00:05:08	SageHand	Well. You're trying to run System.out.println() outside any method.
2012-12-13 00:06:00	ouch	the declarations of userNums are not local
2012-12-13 00:07:05	SageHand	No but you cannot use System.out.println(); irregardless of its content outside of a method.
2012-12-13 00:07:08	ouch	I don't know where I am going from that
2012-12-13 00:07:10	SageHand	try to just put "Hello" inside of it
2012-12-13 00:07:18	SageHand	you'll get an error the same.
2012-12-13 00:07:35	ouch	I did
2012-12-13 00:08:11	SageHand	so just move the print statement inside of a method.
2012-12-13 00:08:18	SageHand	and you'll be fine.
2012-12-13 00:09:00	ouch	and then the decaration of the array after the method (outside of it) asking the user for numbers?
2012-12-13 00:09:39	SageHand	that needs to be inside a method as well, yes.
2012-12-13 00:10:39	SageHand	@47 you put an end bracket for your selectionSlip() method so the code on lines 48 and below belong to no method.
2012-12-13 00:11:09	ouch	but if I put them in a method how can I access the array in another class
2012-12-13 00:11:12	ouch	it's local then
2012-12-13 00:11:39	SageHand	You need to make the array non-local.
2012-12-13 00:12:03	ouch	I have no clue how to do that. I have a feeling you showed me in the pastebin example. but I didn't get it
2012-12-13 00:13:03	SageHand	Imagine a class like a pyramid structure: The class is  the foundation level and everything that builds ontop of that inside the class has access to variables inside of it
2012-12-13 00:13:23	SageHand	so if you make a class, then inside that class make a variable outside of any method, all methods inside that class have access to that variable.
2012-12-13 00:13:48	ouch	yes, I understand that part
2012-12-13 00:14:39	SageHand	actually with the code you currently have. Try to simply change public void selectionSlip(){ to  "public int[] selectionSlip(){"
2012-12-13 00:15:09	SageHand	then at the very end of the method put "return userSelection"
2012-12-13 00:15:48	ouch	done and then?
2012-12-13 00:16:04	ouch	         int[] userSelect = new int[ 6]; (I typed outside of all method)
2012-12-13 00:16:14	ouch	so this is an empty array that I need to fill with userSelection
2012-12-13 00:16:16	ouch	right?
2012-12-13 00:16:45	SageHand	Can I see all of your source code, the other file where you are trying to use userSelection?
2012-12-13 00:17:29	ouch	sure. pastebin everything?
2012-12-13 00:17:49	SageHand	yes
2012-12-13 00:18:59	ouch	http://pastebin.com/NWjL47Nf <-- main

2012-12-13 00:19:59	ouch	http://pastebin.com/NWjL47Nf <-- computer generated and the place where I need check tickets to see if they won. checkTicket method will need userSelection from selectionSlip method in ticket
2012-12-13 00:20:57	SageHand	so your problem is getting userSelection from selectionSlip method into the computer generated class?
2012-12-13 00:21:04	ouch	yes
2012-12-13 00:21:19	ouch	I made selectionSlip main method for a sec just to test out stuff
2012-12-13 00:21:22	ouch	but it isn't
2012-12-13 00:21:32	SageHand	okay. In your selectionSlip code
2012-12-13 00:23:04	SageHand	change public int[] selectionSlip() back to public void selectionSlip()
2012-12-13 00:23:07	SageHand	and remove the return
2012-12-13 00:24:29	SageHand	just above public void selectionSlip(), on line 22. Add a new int array using the following "public int[] intName = new int[6];"
2012-12-13 00:24:57	SageHand	this will make a new int that is global to your ticket class.
2012-12-13 00:25:46	ouch	understood
2012-12-13 00:26:24	SageHand	inside of the for-loop that begins on line 47 put every value from userSelection into this new int array: "intName[i] = userSelection[i];"
2012-12-13 00:26:39	SageHand	now intName has all of the values userSelection has.
2012-12-13 00:27:31	SageHand	create a new method inside the ticket class: "public int[] getMyIntArray(){}"
2012-12-13 00:27:50	ouch	wait
2012-12-13 00:27:54	SageHand	inside this method simply put the 1 line of code: "return intName"
2012-12-13 00:27:59	ouch	so that method has two arrays?
2012-12-13 00:28:09	ouch	userSelection AND the array we made outside?
2012-12-13 00:28:27	SageHand	the class has two arrays
2012-12-13 00:29:11	SageHand	public -> this method can be accessed by other classes, int[] -> this method returns a integer array, getMyIntArray() -> this is the method name without any parameters.
2012-12-13 00:30:09	ouch	What do I do with this int[]    userSelection= {userNum1, userNum2, userNum3, userNum4, userNum5, userNum6}; that I put int he method?
2012-12-13 00:30:29	SageHand	where did you put that?
2012-12-13 00:31:22	ouch	line 45
2012-12-13 00:34:09	SageHand	more importantly where is the "Lottery" class you are refering to in one of the files?
2012-12-13 00:35:12	SageHand	you linked the "lottoapp" twice in the three files you pasted earlier.
2012-12-13 00:35:55	ouch	ahh
2012-12-13 00:35:56	ouch	sorry

2012-12-13 00:36:34	ouch	http://pastebin.com/QHAYUahF <--- ticket with changes
2012-12-13 00:39:41	ouch	I think it works
2012-12-13 00:39:57	ouch	cuz I just successfully print getUserSelected in lottoapp method
2012-12-13 00:40:13	ouch	so I guess I can make an object reference in Lottery
2012-12-13 00:40:17	ouch	and compare the two
2012-12-13 00:40:47	SageHand	you have to compare them inside of Lottery right?
2012-12-13 00:41:00	ouch	yes, in a method called checkTicket
2012-12-13 00:41:09	ouch	and then use that main in lottoapp which is the main
2012-12-13 00:41:39	SageHand	so you will have a public static void main() method inside of lottoapp?
2012-12-13 00:43:14	ouch	yes
2012-12-13 00:43:23	ouch	you want to see lottoapp?
2012-12-13 00:53:16	ouch	I think I am almost done
2012-12-13 00:53:30	ouch	Now I just have to add the encore thing
2012-12-13 00:53:32	ouch	and see if they match
2012-12-13 00:53:49	ouch	the for loop to see if the indices match works

2012-12-13 01:00:01	SageHand	Lottery: http://pastebin.com/HHpjH7KG
2012-12-13 01:00:43	ouch	but I kinda don't want to change my code right now because I made the for loop work (I think) and I don't want to screw ANYTHING up by changing anything
2012-12-13 01:00:44	ouch	:(
2012-12-13 01:01:26	SageHand	its fine, use it as a reference if you get stuck.

2012-12-14 22:56:59	tangentstorm	it doesn't.. ( xy-z ) is fine too... but by convention it would be ( nn-n ) to show that you have removed two (n)umbers from the stack and added back one
2012-12-14 22:57:16	tangentstorm	in fact you don't need the stack comment at all. it's just a comment
2012-12-14 22:57:30	carefish	oh, just saw it was a comment :P
2012-12-14 22:57:38	tangentstorm	you can use normal math operators
2012-12-14 22:57:46	tangentstorm	but it's a stack based language so
2012-12-14 22:57:52	tangentstorm	2 2 +
2012-12-14 22:57:58	tangentstorm	will leave the number 4 on the stack
2012-12-14 22:58:02	carefish	oh
2012-12-14 22:58:07	tangentstorm	2 2 + 2 *
2012-12-14 22:58:07	carefish	so it puts 2 on the stack
2012-12-14 22:58:09	tangentstorm	now it's eight
2012-12-14 22:58:20	tangentstorm	2 2 + 2 * 1 -
2012-12-14 22:58:22	tangentstorm	7
2012-12-14 22:58:27	carefish	then you tell it you want to reserve space for another 2 and add it to the first 2?
2012-12-14 22:58:39	tangentstorm	2 puts a 2 on the stack
2012-12-14 22:58:43	tangentstorm	2 puts another 2 on the stack
2012-12-14 22:59:06	tangentstorm	+ removes the top two numbers on the stack and replaces it with the sum
2012-12-14 22:59:17	tangentstorm	so the stack comment for 2 is ( -n )
2012-12-14 22:59:33	carefish	so how do you do (something * else) ?
2012-12-14 22:59:39	tangentstorm	and for + is ( nn-n )
2012-12-14 22:59:41	tangentstorm	something else *
2012-12-14 22:59:56	tangentstorm	if something is a variable, then
2012-12-14 23:00:04	tangentstorm	something @ else @ *
2012-12-14 23:00:16	tangentstorm	or retro actually offers some syntactic sugar:
2012-12-14 23:00:20	tangentstorm	@something @else *
2012-12-14 23:00:46	carefish	totalFrames frameWidth frameHeight * + frameHeight totalSpritesHeight * ?
2012-12-14 23:01:57	tangentstorm	if those are constants then that's valid
2012-12-14 23:02:08	tangentstorm	for variables you need the @
2012-12-14 23:02:59	tangentstorm	everything in retro is a 32-bit integer on the stack, so variables wind up on the stack as pointers
2012-12-14 23:03:06	tangentstorm	@ reads the value from the address
2012-12-14 23:03:12	tangentstorm	! writes a value to the address
2012-12-14 23:03:24	carefish	ooh
2012-12-14 23:03:46	tangentstorm	it's a very low level language
2012-12-14 23:03:55	tangentstorm	but at the same time very flexible and extensible
2012-12-14 23:04:07	tangentstorm	sort of like a mix of assembly language and lisp :)
2012-12-14 23:04:37	tangentstorm	most of the time in forth you wouldn't use so many variables
2012-12-14 23:04:43	carefish	@totalFrames @frameWidth totalSpritesWidth * + @frameHeight totalSpritesHeight * !
2012-12-14 23:04:57	carefish	(i've never done asm/lisp
2012-12-14 23:06:40	tangentstorm	a = (totalFrames * frameWidth) + totalSpritesWidth ; b = (frameHeight * totalSpritesHeight)
2012-12-14 23:06:57	tangentstorm	and the stack is going to contain  b on top, with a underneath
2012-12-14 23:08:00	tangentstorm	oops... could have sworn i typed "so in c, what you just typed would  be translated as..." :)
2012-12-14 23:09:40	tangentstorm	okay. i'm going to get this zengl thing working. back in a bit. feel free to ask in #retro if you have questions

2012-12-16 17:51:40	carefish	well, 'older' code, if you find it, tends to be _really_ old
2012-12-16 17:52:12	carefish	and C++11 has a few nice features which are good to know that they exist
2012-12-16 17:52:58	carefish	(got to add here, i'm a noob at C++, started 'bout 6-ish months ago)

2012-12-16 17:54:15	carefish	and now tangentstorm got me excited about pascal, so learning that too right now :)
2012-12-16 17:54:18	SageHand	carefish no worries. I started programming about 9 months ago. Most advanced thing I've done is made a small java 2d map you can walk around on with a static sprite.
2012-12-16 17:55:48	SageHand	Is this chat usually this quiet?...
2012-12-16 17:56:00	carefish	it is. only've been here for about a week
2012-12-16 17:56:10	carefish	but the people here are friendlies :)
2012-12-16 17:56:41	biio_	every time I'm in here I feel like I need to start writing more C/C++
2012-12-16 17:57:24	darkf	gods, why?
2012-12-16 17:59:24	biio_	I feel it helps a lot for learning other things, like in C, you have to do most things yourself, so I kind of feel it makes it a good way to further my knowledge in other aspects
2012-12-16 17:59:43	biio_	like moving from ANSI C to Java felt like cheating almost :p
2012-12-16 18:00:10	SageHand	gg carefish. I bought a book because of you. Telling the cyber police to track you down as we speak! So you can reimburse me the cost if it's not woth the investment!
2012-12-16 18:01:13	darkf	the good news is you can learn C++ in 24 hours! the bad news is that it's only 1/80th of it!

2012-12-16 18:02:10	darkf	I'll wait for you!
2012-12-16 18:02:22	@chance	Ew, please avoid C++'s stl.
2012-12-16 18:02:32	darkf	please avoid chance
2012-12-16 18:02:32	@chance	and the other caviots as well.
2012-12-16 18:02:54	SageHand	It will only take 5.2 years at 1 hour a day.
2012-12-16 18:03:04	SageHand	What is stil?
2012-12-16 18:03:04	SageHand	stl*
2012-12-16 18:03:09	@chance	you can learn python in the amount of time it takes to learn pseudocode!
2012-12-16 18:03:11	darkf	SageHand: it's safe to say we're all nerds here, say 6 hours a day.
2012-12-16 18:03:37	SageHand	darkf well I do have to follow my general Software Engineering course as well.
2012-12-16 18:04:56	SageHand	Started Comp. Sci. last year. Decided it was very taxing after doing just Calculus I and II, so I switched this year to Software Eng. So far it's a bit more memorization and more reading material, but definitely easier.
2012-12-16 18:05:27	@chance	thats too bad, calculus is probably one of the least relevant math courses a CS major is required to take
2012-12-16 18:05:51	@chance	i mean its important to know that stuff, it can be used very easily in a lot of applications, but often times your not using calculus
2012-12-16 18:06:17	SageHand	I was told the following math-related subjects would be harder to understand or more complex than Calculus.
2012-12-16 18:07:20	@chance	and you just gave up?
2012-12-16 18:07:23	@chance	and what math courses?
2012-12-16 18:07:52	@chance	you should probably only have 2-3 more
2012-12-16 18:08:04	@chance	1 being vector calc, and the others being discrete math usually
2012-12-16 18:08:14	Phenax	Dunno, most of the mathematics are logic & discrete, which for some people is harder or easier - totally depends on the person
2012-12-16 18:08:24	Phenax	at least in my uni
2012-12-16 18:08:24	@chance	and discrete math isnt that hard, its juust logic based
2012-12-16 18:08:46	@chance	yeah, but he only did calc, which is entirely different from the 'cs focused math'
2012-12-16 18:08:54	SageHand	@chance Well I only just passed Calculus I and II with a C and a D. So I decided it would be more beneficial to me to switch major or quit until I could brush up on math enough I felt confident to continue.
2012-12-16 18:09:23	@chance	i failed calc II with an F
2012-12-16 18:09:25	@chance	and retook it
2012-12-16 18:09:37	@chance	got a B the 2nd time ;P
2012-12-16 18:10:04	@NoaHall	Nothing wrong with doing software engineering; most places will accept it as on the same level as a CS degree
2012-12-16 18:10:46	@chance	NoaHall: nothing wrong with it all, but the people looking at a SE degree vs CS will want them doing a different job based on the degree
2012-12-16 18:11:14	@NoaHall	nahh
2012-12-16 18:11:24	@chance	they are two different fields, SE is much more focused on management level stuff, rather than writing software
2012-12-16 18:11:50	@NoaHall	Perhaps where you're from, but here it's more programming-focused that CS
2012-12-16 18:11:50	SageHand	@chance I can tell by what we have been taught already.
2012-12-16 18:11:53	@NoaHall	than CS
2012-12-16 18:12:28	SageHand	The course here is focused a bit more on management and controlling and especially documenting a development process.
2012-12-16 18:13:04	@NoaHall	I hope you like Java then, heh
2012-12-16 18:13:11	@chance	exactly, if thats what you like, go for it, but honestly if you prefer the 'code' and CS part more
2012-12-16 18:13:11	SageHand	NoaHall We've funnily enough been taught java.
2012-12-16 18:13:24	@chance	dont let the 'CS math is hard' get in the way
2012-12-16 18:13:32	SageHand	Only introductory since I am on the first semester.
2012-12-16 18:13:54	@chance	you should get involved with the IRC bot i just rewrote for LPMC :)
2012-12-16 18:14:17	@chance	https://github.com/LearnProgramming/LPMCBot
2012-12-16 18:14:24	@chance	:)
2012-12-16 18:14:29	@chance	ill be back later though, going to a friends house :)
2012-12-16 18:14:32	@NoaHall	most places tend to tie SE closely with "business" languages like Java
2012-12-16 18:14:38	SageHand	Well I haven't really made up my mind yet. This semester was an odd mixture of Introduction to SE where we were taught a bit about UML, models and processes, and then Interaction Design (User Oriented) where we had a semester project where we had to work together with a local company to develop a prototype for them based on a case they put forward.
2012-12-16 18:14:54	@chance	NoaHall: yeah its unfortunate
2012-12-16 18:15:54	SageHand	We then worked together with a focus group among the targeted demographic for the software we were developing and had to use principles from Interaction Design to develop a prototype.
2012-12-16 18:16:04	SageHand	pretty different from what I expected.
2012-12-16 18:16:30	@NoaHall	Sounds pretty good
2012-12-16 18:16:39	@NoaHall	Well
2012-12-16 18:16:44	@NoaHall	They're teaching you good things.
2012-12-16 18:17:17	@NoaHall	So far on my CS degree, they haven't taught them how to look at requirments or how to decide what technologies to use or how to design things well
2012-12-16 18:17:35	@NoaHall	I mean, they have with some things, like how to manage your code and so on
2012-12-16 18:17:52	@NoaHall	but not in terms of actual end users or requirement documents
2012-12-16 18:18:05	SageHand	I did two semesters on CS here and I hadn't heard of Requirements or Requirements Engineering until now
2012-12-16 18:18:07	@NoaHall	I hate to imagine how my coursemates are going to find working in the real world
2012-12-16 18:19:00	SageHand	How did you come to know about it if it hasn't been taught?
2012-12-16 18:19:38	@NoaHall	I already work
2012-12-16 18:19:42	SageHand	Oh!
2012-12-16 18:19:49	@NoaHall	and was self-taught
2012-12-16 18:20:22	@NoaHall	well, apart from the whole requriements thing and stuff like that, I had to pick that up on the job
2012-12-16 18:20:54	biio_	I'm on my second year in my CS program, so far we mostly do small stuff (although, it's quite hard at times), I kind of fear the day we will suddenly be expected to write a really big project
2012-12-16 18:21:35	SageHand	I hope to self-teach towards something game-related but from reading about the industry it seems more merit-oriented so I decided to go for a general CS now SE degree to have more options if my main goal doesn't work out.
2012-12-16 18:22:22	@NoaHall	The dissertation is usually the biggest thing you're expected to do, and that's basically all theory
2012-12-16 18:22:52	@NoaHall	Some of the stuff the people did here could be done in a couple of hours, and they still got a first xD
2012-12-16 18:23:05	SageHand	The way the SE course is structured here you have to do 1 big project each semester.
2012-12-16 18:23:07	@NoaHall	but the theory writeups they did were good
2012-12-16 18:23:15	@NoaHall	Oh, cool!

2012-12-16 18:23:56	biio_	one thing that started with the course I'm taking right now is less hand holding, previously it has been a lot of "do this by doing this and that" stuff for our labs
2012-12-16 18:24:04	biio_	now it's more like "we want this, do it"
2012-12-16 18:24:14	SageHand	So you're handed the case about 1 week into the semester and you hand in the last day of that semester. (A product / prototype / whatever) depending on the case given and a report documenting the process and your results.
2012-12-16 18:24:48	biio_	although it gets less fun when the TA's decide they want it in a specific way that isn't specified in the instructions...
2012-12-16 18:27:46	SageHand	Something I dislike is that they won't have us do any programming related courses after second semester
2012-12-16 18:28:06	biio_	not at all, or just not for a while?
2012-12-16 18:28:07	SageHand	we're basically given Java I and Java II and then nothing more for the rest of the education.
2012-12-16 18:28:23	SageHand	well.. discrete math, but that's not really programming so much as it is logic.
2012-12-16 18:29:17	SageHand	which is why I'm trying to get some resources on C++ to start doing it on my own time.
2012-12-16 18:32:48	@NoaHall	How good are you at programming ATM?
2012-12-16 18:34:29	SageHand	Well I've done some basic inheritence and polymorphism in Java, but other than that I haven't done anything expect for the assignments we were given this semester and the first year I did on CS.
2012-12-16 18:34:46	SageHand	so I'm quite possibly what you would call very fresh.
2012-12-16 18:35:45	SageHand	Most of the time if I got stuck I've been able to understand the java API, and if not that I've been searching stack overflow for use examples similar to my problem.
2012-12-16 18:38:24	SageHand	Not sure if that answers the question.
2012-12-16 18:39:45	SageHand	 I've been taught the general concept of memory and CPU architecture as well.
2012-12-16 18:39:45	@NoaHall	What part of game making are you interested in?

2012-12-16 18:41:20	@NoaHall	Which bits of the programming? Logic, engine, graphics, etc?
2012-12-16 18:41:57	SageHand	So far I've been most interested in the engine. I've been following a couple of tutorials on how to make some 2d engines and I've been making my own itterations on them. Nothing complex.
2012-12-16 18:43:06	SageHand	Physics simulation is very interesting as well.
2012-12-16 18:43:16	SageHand	how to model stuff like that is pretty fascinating.
2012-12-16 18:44:27	@NoaHall	I think you might have more fun playing with Jogl/lwjgl or Unity

2012-12-16 18:45:33	SageHand	I have to say though; So far I don't know anyone who is interested in game design and there aren't any local businesses in that industry so I'm approaching it a bit like a hobbyist, learning what I need to know along the way to build something resembling a finished game.
2012-12-16 18:46:57	tangentstorm	<- making a game right now
2012-12-16 18:47:19	SageHand	I tried using unity but I get this feeling of a knot in my stomach every time. Something about using a tool or engine like that just really sits wrong with me. It's like I won't be satisfied unless I'm building on a framework I worked on from scratch. Irregardless of whether it's conducive to a future career or whether it's efficient.
2012-12-16 18:48:14	tangentstorm	SageHand: is it that you have to build it from scratch or just that you want to understand what you're using from the ground up?
2012-12-16 18:48:42	SageHand	tangentstorm I think It's mostly the academic part about understanding everything fundamentally; Having actually done it before using higher-level tools.
2012-12-16 18:49:35	biio_	speakiong of game design
2012-12-16 18:49:40	biio_	* speaking
2012-12-16 18:49:41	SageHand	I can best describe it as feeling unwashed and dirty when trying to use, as example, Unity.
2012-12-16 18:49:50	SageHand	I know it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Doesn't to me either :)
2012-12-16 18:50:14	biio_	I've been toying with the idea of doing something simple to get a bit more comfortable with graphics, any recommendations for a library?
2012-12-16 18:50:22	biio_	I'm thinking opengl, but I dont know what is out there
2012-12-16 18:50:49	tangentstorm	biio_: just depends what you want to accomplish, and what you mean by graphics
2012-12-16 18:51:05	tangentstorm	if you just want to make cool pictures, i can't recommend processing.org enough
2012-12-16 18:51:06	SageHand	#reddit-gamedev might have some suggestions.
2012-12-16 18:51:43	biio_	tangentstorm: I have no set goals really, it's just that I've never done anything real with graphics, only a memory game using swing
2012-12-16 18:51:43	<--	Phenax (~Kyle@70.118.74.75) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2012-12-16 18:51:47	@NoaHall	Processing is decent for making things, but for the love of god avoid using the IDE and import it as a library in Java
2012-12-16 18:52:00	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-16 18:52:02	biio_	so you know, anything, like pong or a very simple rougelike
2012-12-16 18:52:38	biio_	* roguelike, I always make that error
2012-12-16 18:52:40	SageHand	I followed a tutorial on youtube that was easy for me to understand (Java) on how to make a small 2d game using Swing and Canvas.
2012-12-16 18:52:43	tangentstorm	biio_: well for a *completely* different take on how to do graphics, there's Elm. he actually has a pong tutorial on his site
2012-12-16 18:53:56	biio_	tangentstorm: hm, that could be interesting
2012-12-16 18:54:09	SageHand	tangentstorm what kind of game are you making?
2012-12-16 18:54:56	biio_	I've been really interested in how pathfinding works in games, now I'm starting to have the knowledge to actually read up on it
2012-12-16 18:55:14	SageHand	apparently A* is very common.
2012-12-16 18:57:17	tangentstorm	SageHand: well the goal was to make a game with http://retroforth.org/ and http://freepascal.org/ for the 72-hour game jam going on this weekend at http://ludumdare.com/
2012-12-16 18:58:00	tangentstorm	we ran into a bunch of problems just getting a pixel on the screen though so we don't have much to show for it at all yet
2012-12-16 18:59:24	SageHand	tangentstorm have a stream open of someone making a game for that ludumdare
2012-12-16 18:59:24	biio_	there's a LPMC-project for the A* algorithm I belive, might look into it now that I have the winter break comming up
2012-12-16 18:59:37	SageHand	It's a kind of Tower Defense where you send the monsters instead of buid the towers from what I could gather.
2012-12-16 19:02:05	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-16 19:02:19	tangentstorm	yeah the theme for the compo is 'you are the villain'
2012-12-16 19:03:04	SageHand	He decided to balance it by not adding missile homing. So your monsters can run thru if you send them strategically.
2012-12-16 19:05:14	SageHand	How often is this Ludum dare thing?
2012-12-16 19:07:04	tangentstorm	SageHand: every few months
2012-12-16 19:07:24	tangentstorm	there's also pyweek once or twice a year
2012-12-16 19:07:24	tangentstorm	gives you a little more time
2012-12-16 19:07:30	tangentstorm	reddit has a bacon jam
2012-12-16 19:07:34	SageHand	pretty cool.
2012-12-16 19:07:38	tangentstorm	it happens at completely random times
2012-12-16 19:07:56	SageHand	maybe I'll be far enough along with learning I can join in next time.
2012-12-16 19:08:08	tangentstorm	what's your language of choice?
2012-12-16 19:08:24	SageHand	so far It'd be Java.
2012-12-16 19:08:26	SageHand	since I'm most versed in that.
2012-12-16 19:08:30	SageHand	but Idk :)
2012-12-16 19:08:30	tangentstorm	http://www.gamesketchlib.org/
2012-12-16 19:08:44	tangentstorm	<- my java offering ( using processing )
2012-12-16 19:09:06	SageHand	I would be super excited to do C++ but in honesty I'm not going to learn that fast haha
2012-12-16 19:09:21	SageHand	processing?
2012-12-16 19:09:43	tangentstorm	processing.org
2012-12-16 19:10:16	tangentstorm	it's basically a pre-processor for java... makes it really handy to get graphics up on the screen quickly
2012-12-16 19:10:44	tangentstorm	also compiles to javascript or android apps
2012-12-16 19:11:02	SageHand	wow cool.
2012-12-16 19:11:35	SageHand	the only method I've ever used is setting the color of each pixel respectively in a graphics element then rendering it afterwards pixel by pixel.
2012-12-16 19:11:54	SageHand	so a lot of looping
2012-12-16 19:12:16	tangentstorm	much more high level
2012-12-16 19:13:05	tangentstorm	i made some videos as i was learning ( at the bottom of the page there )... they're kind of basic though
2012-12-16 19:15:25	SageHand	so basically processing is simpler to use?

2012-12-16 19:20:54	tangentstorm	it generates a bunch of code for you behind the scenes
2012-12-16 19:21:05	tangentstorm	like you can just say  "rectangle(10,10,150,50);"
2012-12-16 19:21:14	tangentstorm	and that's your whole program.
2012-12-16 19:21:14	tangentstorm	no public static void main or anything
2012-12-16 19:21:44	tangentstorm	but then youcan take the same code and put it into a normal java app and it'll run fine too

2012-12-16 21:51:33	carefish	ooh
2012-12-16 21:51:38	carefish	just add it to uses?
2012-12-16 21:52:39	tangentstorm	probably when you create Form3 you can also pass a reference back to that value...
2012-12-16 21:52:55	tangentstorm	or you can put all your model data in a central non-gui object
2012-12-16 21:53:21	tangentstorm	keeping all your logic in the gui is easy to write but hard to maintain.
2012-12-16 21:54:17	carefish	so one object holding all the form vars, and the form units having their own dispatchers calling the proper stuff from the object holding all the form vars?
2012-12-16 21:54:38	tangentstorm	carefish: google "model view controller" pattern
2012-12-16 21:54:45	carefish	i know that pattern
2012-12-16 21:54:53	carefish	i'll implement it :)
2012-12-16 21:54:59	carefish	atleast try to, haha.
2012-12-16 21:55:43	carefish	the 'view' part is all the forms with their eventdispatchers, and the controller part is where all the logic is right?
2012-12-16 21:55:55	carefish	not sure how to implement mvc in pascal

2012-12-16 23:16:07	tangentstorm	carefish: scientific method, yes
2012-12-16 23:16:14	tangentstorm	don't do all your experiments at once
2012-12-16 23:16:19	tangentstorm	isolate the variables

2012-12-16 23:16:45	carefish	how can i draw outside of a form? O_o
2012-12-16 23:17:34	tangentstorm	if you're in the middle of a mess, don't keep changing things... roll back your changes and make a branch, or start a new experiment off to the side or something
2012-12-16 23:17:37	tangentstorm	beats me
2012-12-16 23:17:53	tangentstorm	google shaped forms in lazarus
2012-12-16 23:18:00	tangentstorm	i think there's a shaped window example
2012-12-16 23:18:12	tangentstorm	or maybe use a transparent form?

2012-12-18 15:56:44	zzyzzyxx	It says "Save Unit1.pas as MainForm.pas: Lazarus saves the unit in the file mainform.pas and the form data in the file mainform.lfm. The unit is renamed to MainForm."
2012-12-18 15:57:01	zzyzzyxx	Which implies that if you save something with that name Lazarus will do the rest

2012-12-18 16:57:15	__Eric	Is it inadvisable to have a loop in a recursive function?
2012-12-18 16:59:39	zzyzzyxx	There is nothing wrong with that in general. If you need to loop over something in every recursive call, do it. Although if you're recalculating the same values in every call then you should rethink it
2012-12-18 16:59:52	@Enalicho	Recursion itself is inadvisable in Java, but there's nothing wrong with having a loop inside one. It depends what your loop is doing, though

2012-12-18 17:01:21	__Eric	Well.. I want to make this small program that will cascade. Basically it will go through a loop for every element in a list, generate a random number and if that number is > x it will generate a new element and put into the list.
2012-12-18 17:01:52	__Eric	the function will call recursively until the list is empty. (elements are removed if their value is 0)
2012-12-18 17:02:02	__Eric	Not even sure if I can do this with java or not, but I'm trying.
2012-12-18 17:02:52	@Enalicho	Hmm, not sure I understand what you're trying to do.

2012-12-18 17:03:34	@Enalicho	Hehe, alright
2012-12-18 17:03:51	zzyzzyxx	Enalicho: why do you say recursion is ill-advised in Java? Because there is no tail call optimization?
2012-12-18 17:04:22	zzyzzyxx	Eric: if i understand your problem correctly, it's not a time where you would want to use recursion at all

2012-12-18 17:06:42	__Eric	zzyzzyxx then what would I do instead?
2012-12-18 17:08:12	@Enalicho	zzyzzyxx: A few things - debugging a recursive method isn't plesant with java debuggers and they're slower and there's no tail optimization as you said. Of course, there are places to use recursion, but it's usually better not to :)
2012-12-18 17:09:02	zzyzzyxx	Nested loops. Recursion is good when you can break a problem into a smaller problem that you treat the same way, like traversing down a tree. Each subtree is a tree in it's own right, just a smaller one that you had before.

2012-12-18 21:30:51	carefish	meh, just pushed the entire project folder :P
2012-12-18 21:30:53	tangentstorm	it's the "session" stuff and it'll change all the time... like it tracks which windows you have open
2012-12-18 21:31:17	tangentstorm	you probably want to put that in your .gitignore along with backup and lib
2012-12-18 21:32:49	tangentstorm	carefish: you also don't need these Get/Set methods in objpas... it has properties like c#
2012-12-18 21:33:15	carefish	oh, i got used to doing it that way w/ C++ :P
2012-12-18 21:34:07	@zzyzzyxx	you shouldn't use them that much in C++ either :)
2012-12-18 21:34:39	carefish	really?
2012-12-18 21:35:17	carefish	i'm a newbie at programming, i read a few times that it's "neater"
2012-12-18 21:35:19	@zzyzzyxx	Really. They teach getters and setters in college a lot, but in practice they're indicative of poor design
2012-12-18 21:35:51	carefish	i didn't learn C++ from college, taught it myself :P
2012-12-18 21:35:57	@zzyzzyxx	It's better to design objects around their behavior rather than the data that they hold
2012-12-18 21:36:56	@zzyzzyxx	College isn't the important part there, heh, although it is a problem. It gets taught in college and proliferated through forums and people "helping" each other and such
2012-12-18 21:37:00	@zzyzzyxx	But anyway
2012-12-18 21:37:20	@zzyzzyxx	If you need to set somthing for an object, it should be given to it through the constructor
2012-12-18 21:37:35	@zzyzzyxx	Thereafter its best if the object itself manages any changes to it
2012-12-18 21:37:46	@zzyzzyxx	That means no direct setters
2012-12-18 21:38:07	@zzyzzyxx	It should only change if it's necessary for it to change so that the object can do what it needs
2012-12-18 21:39:18	carefish	..and how do i make git remove lib/ and *.lps files?
2012-12-18 21:41:22	@zzyzzyxx	create/edit a .gitignore file and add those to it
2012-12-18 21:41:33	@zzyzzyxx	or do you mean remove from the history/repository?
2012-12-18 21:41:33	carefish	i did :o
2012-12-18 21:41:37	carefish	yeah
2012-12-18 21:42:27	tangentstorm	carefish: you can edit the commit database... this is also something i've been meaning to do but haven't
2012-12-18 21:42:37	tangentstorm	haven't gotten around to learning i mean
2012-12-18 21:42:57	carefish	ah
2012-12-18 21:42:58	@zzyzzyxx	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1143796/git-remove-a-file-from-the-repository-without-deleting-it-from-the-local-filesy
2012-12-18 21:43:41	tangentstorm	carefish: .gitignore is local to a directory, so you don't need all this stuff in your .gitignore either
2012-12-18 21:48:54	carefish	okay, i did that command, and comitted/synced, why is it still on the repository?
2012-12-18 21:49:07	carefish	ah well, who cares.. really :P
2012-12-18 21:49:19	tangentstorm	well me
2012-12-18 21:49:36	tangentstorm	because i can't see what i changed now because all those files are in the way
2012-12-18 21:49:47	tangentstorm	clogging up the output of git status / git diff
2012-12-18 21:50:36	tangentstorm	carefish: you also have to "git rm -f *.exe *.lps lib/*"
2012-12-18 21:50:55	tangentstorm	carefish: "git rm -rf *.exe *.lps lib/*"  .. forgot the r in rm -rf
2012-12-18 21:52:27	tangentstorm	carefish: i have the form stuff working for you
2012-12-18 21:54:52	tangentstorm	sent a pull request
2012-12-18 21:57:22	carefish	dear lord, what have i got myself into
2012-12-18 21:57:34	tangentstorm	haha
2012-12-18 21:57:36	carefish	really confusing why it's not deleting it on the repo.
2012-12-18 21:57:46	tangentstorm	carefish: accept my pull request
2012-12-18 21:57:49	tangentstorm	it fixes that for you
2012-12-18 21:58:29	tangentstorm	i'll send you the actual code changes i make in a minute... i'm running an older lazarus so i'm upgrading
2012-12-18 21:58:37	tangentstorm	( it writes the version in the files )
2012-12-18 21:59:52	carefish	how do i accept the merge?
2012-12-18 22:00:17	tangentstorm	carefish: log into git hub and there should be a sort of blue circle icon in the upper left
2012-12-18 22:00:59	tangentstorm	hopefully it'll say "this can be automatically merged"
2012-12-18 22:01:25	carefish	that's not what it's saying
2012-12-18 22:01:38	tangentstorm	in the pull request it self i mean
2012-12-18 22:01:45	carefish	This pull request cannot be automatically merged.
2012-12-18 22:01:47	tangentstorm	either that or it'll make a conflict
2012-12-18 22:01:48	tangentstorm	ah
2012-12-18 22:02:17	tangentstorm	what are the options?
2012-12-18 22:03:22	carefish	..there are none?
2012-12-18 22:03:29	tangentstorm	hmm
2012-12-18 22:03:55	tangentstorm	okay, well forget that then
2012-12-18 22:03:57	tangentstorm	do this:
2012-12-18 22:04:26	carefish	i added a new branch
2012-12-18 22:04:28	tangentstorm	cd {project root} ; git rm -rf *.exe lib/*
2012-12-18 22:04:47	carefish	and did a pullrequest from your master to my testing branch
2012-12-18 22:05:05	carefish	already did that command :P
2012-12-18 22:05:06	tangentstorm	git rm --cached *.lps
2012-12-18 22:05:12	tangentstorm	you have to commit the rm
2012-12-18 22:05:17	tangentstorm	git commit
2012-12-18 22:05:18	tangentstorm	git push
2012-12-18 22:05:52	tangentstorm	the --cached just leaves your working copy ... no big deal if you delete that file but then you have to reopen all your tabs in lazarus next time
2012-12-18 22:07:21	carefish	..it's confusing the crap out of me
2012-12-18 22:07:29	carefish	it says i can't commit
2012-12-18 22:07:37	tangentstorm	yeah
2012-12-18 22:07:39	carefish	nor push because everything is up to date
2012-12-18 22:07:59	tangentstorm	merging in git is not intuitive at all
2012-12-18 22:08:09	tangentstorm	it's because we changed the same files
2012-12-18 22:08:18	carefish	i don't get the idea of commit and push
2012-12-18 22:08:27	carefish	aren't they essentially the same thing?
2012-12-18 22:08:33	tangentstorm	carefish: in your .git directory there's a database of all the changes
2012-12-18 22:08:37	tangentstorm	the changes are called commits
2012-12-18 22:09:05	carefish	..fuck it, ima remove the repo
2012-12-18 22:09:11	carefish	re-add it w/ proper .gitignore
2012-12-18 22:09:21	tangentstorm	that's probably not a bad idea
2012-12-18 22:10:12	tangentstorm	just delete the .git directory and re-run git init
2012-12-18 22:11:29	tangentstorm	carefish: anyway, "push" is what copies your commit database to a remote repository... your github account in this case
2012-12-18 22:12:56	tangentstorm	you can actually just pull directly from my fork to your local copy without using github's pull request forms... that's just something they created to manage the process better
2012-12-18 22:12:56	carefish	lib / *.exe *.lps should be ignored right?
2012-12-18 22:12:57	tangentstorm	yep
2012-12-18 22:13:00	tangentstorm	lib/
2012-12-18 22:13:08	carefish	yeh
2012-12-18 22:13:17	tangentstorm	or "lib" maybe. i always put the slash
2012-12-18 22:13:38	tangentstorm	also "backup"
2012-12-18 22:14:18	carefish	https://github.com/carefish/ALPHA-CU
2012-12-18 22:14:19	carefish	...
2012-12-18 22:14:28	carefish	backup already got ignored
2012-12-18 22:15:45	carefish	now i know why most programmers shy away from version control
2012-12-18 22:16:08	carefish	it's unnecessarily complicated
2012-12-18 22:16:16	carefish	ofcourse, once you got it set up it's easy...
2012-12-18 22:16:58	@zzyzzyxx	there's a learning curve, to be sure, but it's not that complicated. you could try Mercurial instead
2012-12-18 22:16:59	carefish	omfg..
2012-12-18 22:17:08	carefish	apparently
2012-12-18 22:17:08	carefish	when you delete a repo
2012-12-18 22:17:18	carefish	you can't re-add it under the same name
2012-12-18 22:17:21	carefish	and if you give the repo a different name
2012-12-18 22:17:29	carefish	it changes the directory too
2012-12-18 22:17:39	tangentstorm	hmm
2012-12-18 22:17:46	carefish	so now obviously it's empty because it's in the wrong folder
2012-12-18 22:17:48	@zzyzzyxx	what commands are you running? i've never had that problem
2012-12-18 22:17:58	carefish	not using the shell
2012-12-18 22:17:58	@zzyzzyxx	ah
2012-12-18 22:17:58	-->	ocfx (~ocfx@unaffiliated/omegacfx) has joined #learnprogramming
2012-12-18 22:18:08	carefish	right now: i just want to port this app
2012-12-18 22:18:22	carefish	and i keep gettin' hitches along the way :P
2012-12-18 22:18:53	tangentstorm	carefish: well... was -alfa part of the name of the app anyway? :)
2012-12-18 22:19:41	@zzyzzyxx	can you go to the command line? it may be easier to walk you through a fresh setup
2012-12-18 22:20:08	 *	tangentstorm 's favorite part of lazarus is how it recompiles itself when you add/remove packages
2012-12-18 22:20:08	carefish	fucking shitty fucksfhoufhoew i really am not liking this gui
2012-12-18 22:20:26	carefish	it doesn't allow me to change the directory
2012-12-18 22:20:32	carefish	it demands it's the same name as the repo name
2012-12-18 22:20:46	tangentstorm	hmmm.. kind of weak
2012-12-18 22:20:55	carefish	repo name: blabla results in: c:\proj\pascal\clipupload\blabla
2012-12-18 22:21:48	carefish	okay screw this
2012-12-18 22:21:58	carefish	what are the shell commands?
2012-12-18 22:22:32	tangentstorm	fair warning: there are going to be some other hitches this way
2012-12-18 22:22:46	tangentstorm	mostly you just need to set up an ssh key
2012-12-18 22:23:46	carefish	so far for github being userfriendly.
2012-12-18 22:23:52	tangentstorm	http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=net+installer
2012-12-18 22:23:56	@zzyzzyxx	okay. make a new directory.
2012-12-18 22:23:58	@zzyzzyxx	mkdir <project name>
2012-12-18 22:24:38	tangentstorm	carefish: that's for if you don't already have git and git bash installed.
2012-12-18 22:24:58	tangentstorm	hello, zzyzzyxx by the way. :)
2012-12-18 22:25:02	carefish	already have git shell
2012-12-18 22:25:18	carefish	i can't use an existing directory?
2012-12-18 22:25:27	tangentstorm	sure
2012-12-18 22:25:38	@zzyzzyxx	You can
2012-12-18 22:25:50	tangentstorm	just delete the .git directory and all the junk files, and then run git init
2012-12-18 22:26:00	tangentstorm	it doesn't add anything until you say to add it
2012-12-18 22:26:08	@zzyzzyxx	tangent: hello. i've been following this conversation - just busy in r/learnprograming
2012-12-18 22:26:52	carefish	http://img.is1337.eu/3c06270b.png
2012-12-18 22:27:02	tangentstorm	yeah, i saw you show up the other day and i see you have a @ so you must  be pretty active, but i don't recall having met you before :)
2012-12-18 22:27:10	carefish	how do i get rid of that 'master'?
2012-12-18 22:27:22	tangentstorm	master is the branch name
2012-12-18 22:27:30	carefish	i haven't run git init yet
2012-12-18 22:27:38	@zzyzzyxx	delete the .git directory
2012-12-18 22:27:41	tangentstorm	the old .git directory is there
2012-12-18 22:28:10	carefish	http://img.is1337.eu/ba701d3f.png
2012-12-18 22:28:16	carefish	it's not?
2012-12-18 22:28:28	@zzyzzyxx	tangent: i'm the only active mod in r/learnprogramming. i used to be on IRC some 6 months ago. just starting getting back to it recently
2012-12-18 22:28:46	@zzyzzyxx	it's usually a hidden directory
2012-12-18 22:28:58	tangentstorm	carefish: it's only ever in the topmost directory... perhaps it's above? ( or yeah... hidden )
2012-12-18 22:30:20	tangentstorm	carefish: in windows explorer, there should be a folder options somewhere to show hidden files... it's under "organize" in windows 7.. then view / hidden files and foldersÌÌ
2012-12-18 22:30:28	carefish	thanks zzyzzyxx, apparently i forgot to turn off 'don't show hidden files'
2012-12-18 22:30:38	carefish	usually i never forget that O_o
2012-12-18 22:30:46	tangentstorm	new computer?
2012-12-18 22:30:50	carefish	sort-of
2012-12-18 22:30:58	@zzyzzyxx	I hear ya. it's one of the first things i do with a new windows install
2012-12-18 22:31:09	carefish	new computer: haven't had the need for showing hidden files past 3 years
2012-12-18 22:31:23	carefish	so i forgot to do it
2012-12-18 22:31:29	carefish	okay, so after the git init
2012-12-18 22:31:38	carefish	i guess i need to change gitignore?
2012-12-18 22:31:58	@zzyzzyxx	if it doesn't have what you want, yes
2012-12-18 22:32:08	carefish	well, it hasn't created .gitignore yet
2012-12-18 22:32:18	tangentstorm	it won't
2012-12-18 22:32:28	tangentstorm	that's something that app did and it made a mess
2012-12-18 22:32:46	tangentstorm	just make a new text file with that name, or copy the other one over and delete all the non-lazarus stuff
2012-12-18 22:33:14	tangentstorm	basically just leave the lines *.exe *.lps lib/ backup/  plus whatever else you want
2012-12-18 22:33:37	tangentstorm	then "git add .gitignore"
2012-12-18 22:33:58	tangentstorm	and then you need to create the repo at github again
2012-12-18 22:34:03	tangentstorm	and then you're going to want to set up an ssh key
2012-12-18 22:34:58	@zzyzzyxx	tangent: he can do without the ssh key for now i think. github supports http commits, doesn't it?
2012-12-18 22:35:00	carefish	https://github.com/carefish/cu-alfa
2012-12-18 22:35:28	tangentstorm	yeah, but at least when i do it, i have to type my username and password every time
2012-12-18 22:35:51	carefish	i believe i did have that set up somewhere
2012-12-18 22:35:59	carefish	had to use git for school once or twice
2012-12-18 22:36:18	tangentstorm	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5343068/is-there-a-way-to-skip-password-typing-when-using-https-github
2012-12-18 22:36:18	tangentstorm	oh. nice :)
2012-12-18 22:36:40	tangentstorm	https://user:password@github.com/ ... why didn't i think to try that?
2012-12-18 22:36:41	carefish	not sure where anymore
2012-12-18 22:37:08	carefish	but i had it set up to automagically use the ssh keys w/o asking for password stuff
2012-12-18 22:37:13	tangentstorm	ah ok
2012-12-18 22:37:14	@zzyzzyxx	i'd probably leave out the password from that line
2012-12-18 22:37:15	tangentstorm	cool
2012-12-18 22:37:30	@zzyzzyxx	right, so, good to go now, yeah?
2012-12-18 22:37:31	tangentstorm	yeah... there's a git-credential-winstore linked from the thing
2012-12-18 22:37:38	carefish	think so
2012-12-18 22:37:48	carefish	now, let's get that merge working
2012-12-18 22:37:49	tangentstorm	carefish: no!!!
2012-12-18 22:37:51	@zzyzzyxx	that wasn't so painless once you skipped the GUI mess :)
2012-12-18 22:37:56	carefish	and after this ima read the git help files
2012-12-18 22:38:13	tangentstorm	i will refork your repo
2012-12-18 22:38:23	carefish	oh, okay
2012-12-18 22:38:26	@zzyzzyxx	carefish: http://git-scm.com/book
2012-12-18 22:39:18	carefish	awesome
2012-12-18 22:39:18	carefish	thanks
2012-12-18 22:40:38	carefish	C:\Users\%username%\.ssh
2012-12-18 22:40:45	carefish	that's where i have my .git ssh keys
2012-12-18 22:45:49	carefish	thanks for the help w/ git :)
2012-12-18 22:46:10	@zzyzzyxx	sure thing
2012-12-18 22:46:30	@zzyzzyxx	i've found it easier to work with on the command line than any other way
2012-12-18 22:47:39	carefish	well, to create the .gitignore file i used the gui version again
2012-12-18 22:48:14	ocfx	command line is faster for most purpose if you know what you're doing
2012-12-18 22:51:18	carefish	what about that pull request tangentstorm?
2012-12-18 22:54:30	@zzyzzyxx	he re-forked, right? you can probably just get rid of the old one
2012-12-18 22:57:27	tangentstorm	carefish: https://github.com/tangentstorm/cu-alfa/commits/master
2012-12-18 22:57:59	tangentstorm	apparently the pull request is for the branch by default, not the individual commits
2012-12-18 22:59:08	tangentstorm	carefish: the one about properties is just to show you how to do it... you don't actually need that file if you use the approach i took in the other commit
2012-12-18 23:01:07	carefish	oh, that property is amazing
2012-12-18 23:01:17	carefish	nice'n'readable, like i know from C#
2012-12-18 23:01:37	tangentstorm	yep
2012-12-18 23:01:57	tangentstorm	you can also have it trigger a getter or setter behind the scenes
2012-12-18 23:02:26	tangentstorm	or make it read-only / write only or i assume read from one and write to another if you wanted :)
2012-12-18 23:02:45	ocfx	some tutorials/textbooks on beginner level program tend to emphasize like diagramming or flow charts a lot
2012-12-18 23:02:50	ocfx	programming*
2012-12-18 23:03:29	ocfx	I dont think i've ever tried that
2012-12-18 23:03:38	ocfx	I wonder if it would make me organized
2012-12-18 23:03:43	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-18 23:04:46	ocfx	f
2012-12-18 23:05:00	carefish	so now i can make the boolean in settings form as a property and then use that property in the mainform?
2012-12-18 23:05:13	tangentstorm	it's not just for beginners... although you're more likely to see things like UML diagrams in professional dev shops
2012-12-18 23:05:25	tangentstorm	carefish: see the other commit
2012-12-18 23:05:29	tangentstorm	i did exactly that.
2012-12-18 23:05:34	tangentstorm	using showmodal
2012-12-18 23:05:40	ocfx	Im just always so antsy to start programming
2012-12-18 23:05:55	carefish	ooh
2012-12-18 23:05:57	tangentstorm	i didn't make it a property because there's no logic attached. i just left it public.
2012-12-18 23:06:21	carefish	so now all i have to do in mainform is: if HideDonateButton = True then Image1.Visible := False; ?
2012-12-18 23:06:35	tangentstorm	carefish: i did that too
2012-12-18 23:06:37	carefish	settingsform.hidedonatebutton
2012-12-18 23:06:54	tangentstorm	image1.Visible := not settingsform.HideDonateButton
2012-12-18 23:07:00	carefish	oh, i am still unsure how to browse through git :P reading the git book, trying out pascal code at the same time
2012-12-18 23:07:02	tangentstorm	that does what you just said
2012-12-18 23:07:13	carefish	awesome
2012-12-18 23:08:14	tangentstorm	in fact, you could drop the intermediate boolean altogether and look directly at the checkbox, but then you're coupling the login in main to the view in the settings form
2012-12-18 23:08:52	tangentstorm	this boolean value gives you a model to work with so you could change the gui independently.
2012-12-18 23:09:48	tangentstorm	if you refactored it further into a "settings" object, then you could load and save that settings object from a config file
2012-12-18 23:09:59	tangentstorm	and the settingls form
2012-12-18 23:10:19	tangentstorm	er... and the settings form could change independently of that too
2012-12-18 23:10:19	carefish	i just dropped the intermediate boolean as it was cluttering up code
2012-12-18 23:10:40	carefish	Image1.Visible := not settingsform.HideDonateButton;
2012-12-18 23:10:43	carefish	sooooo
2012-12-18 23:10:48	carefish	i could do
2012-12-18 23:10:59	tangentstorm	settingsform.HideDonateButton is the intermediate boolean.
2012-12-18 23:11:00	carefish	Image1.Visible := not settingsform.checkbox.value (not correct syntax)
2012-12-18 23:11:03	carefish	yeah
2012-12-18 23:11:10	carefish	just realized that
2012-12-18 23:11:14	tangentstorm	yes but i promise you it's a bad and messy idea :)
2012-12-18 23:11:30	carefish	heh, yeah, gotcha
2012-12-18 23:11:38	tangentstorm	however, i'm a firm believer in letting people make their own mistakes :)
2012-12-18 23:11:49	carefish	what i meant by intermediate boolean was the TClipupload thingy :)
2012-12-18 23:11:51	tangentstorm	ah yeah
2012-12-18 23:12:01	carefish	that thing is pointless w/ this in place
2012-12-18 23:12:06	tangentstorm	i started with that one before i realized it wasn't useful
2012-12-18 23:12:10	carefish	and i understand how to pass along stuff now :)
2012-12-18 23:12:19	carefish	it was useful
2012-12-18 23:12:24	carefish	now i know how to make properties in pascal :P
2012-12-18 23:12:29	tangentstorm	i meant "wasn't used"
2012-12-18 23:12:39	carefish	:P
2012-12-18 23:12:49	carefish	does qt4 remember those checkboxes?
2012-12-18 23:13:08	carefish	or do i need to store it's value in, for example, a simple .txt file?
2012-12-18 23:19:23	tangentstorm	i don't think it's using QT unless you told it to use QT
2012-12-18 23:19:59	tangentstorm	and no it won't remember the checkboxes
2012-12-18 23:20:44	tangentstorm	that's what i was saying: move that boolean to a new settings class that you can load and save to disk and also use as the model for communicating between the two forms
2012-12-18 23:37:09	carefish	btw, what's showmodal?
2012-12-18 23:39:43	carefish	ah i get it :)
2012-12-18 23:39:59	carefish	not sure what 'modal' means, but i see the difference

2012-12-20 21:59:15	carefish	cu_progressbar is the unit's name
2012-12-20 21:59:34	tangentstorm	don't you have to actually create it or something?
2012-12-20 21:59:53	carefish	there should be an lfm too
2012-12-20 22:00:06	carefish	i don't think so?
2012-12-20 22:00:13	tangentstorm	so lazarus does that for you... ok
2012-12-20 22:00:13	tangentstorm	cool
2012-12-20 22:00:15	carefish	just add the unit to uses and you can call /show
2012-12-20 22:00:23	carefish	eh, .show
2012-12-20 22:01:04	tangentstorm	well first: if _ftp.StoreFile(md5str + '.png', false) = true then
2012-12-20 22:01:13	tangentstorm	stop saying = true everywhere :)
2012-12-20 22:01:43	tangentstorm	but it's only going to show if storefile returns true
2012-12-20 22:02:36	tangentstorm	why not just do progressform.Show; _ftp.StoreFile(md5str + '.png', false);    progressform.Hide;
2012-12-20 22:02:43	tangentstorm	?
2012-12-20 22:06:02	tangentstorm	carefish: try setting a breakpoint on line 56 ( _FTP := TFTPSend.Create; )
2012-12-20 22:08:21	tangentstorm	line 49 is your problem: if md5str <> '' then ...
2012-12-20 22:08:27	tangentstorm	don't test for this, assert it.
2012-12-20 22:08:33	tangentstorm	assert( md5str <> '' );
2012-12-20 22:08:43	tangentstorm	and you'll see the assertion fails. :)

2012-12-20 22:35:23	carefish	i'll upload what i have now, because i just noticed it was older code.
2012-12-20 22:39:02	carefish	it's there :)
2012-12-20 22:40:58	tangentstorm	it still has the same problem.
2012-12-20 22:41:59	carefish	yeah, see what i mean? :P
2012-12-20 22:42:21	tangentstorm	re-read what i said above and actually try it
2012-12-20 22:42:31	tangentstorm	the problem is obvious if you do that
2012-12-20 22:43:44	carefish	hmm, setting a breakpoint on ftp create tells me the first time you try to make a screenshot it doesn't execute FTP()
2012-12-20 22:43:54	tangentstorm	yeah.. now try again :)
2012-12-20 22:44:14	carefish	yeah, then it breaks
2012-12-20 22:44:24	tangentstorm	yes but WHEN does it break?
2012-12-20 22:44:43	carefish	the second time you use the FTP menu from the trayicon's popup
2012-12-20 22:45:08	tangentstorm	okay... so do the part about the assertion on line 49
2012-12-20 22:45:56	tangentstorm	don't use a test for things that you believe should always be true. assert them so you're alerted to the problem
2012-12-20 22:46:34	tangentstorm	[ and especially don't test for them and not provide an else clause :) ]
2012-12-20 22:46:45	carefish	 Reset(_file);  breaks now?
2012-12-20 22:47:00	tangentstorm	hmm
2012-12-20 22:47:14	tangentstorm	well that's a good sign but it also means  the assertion didn't fire
2012-12-20 22:47:34	tangentstorm	i always include it in my standard xpc.inc
2012-12-20 22:47:40	tangentstorm	there's a compiler flag you can set though
2012-12-20 22:48:06	carefish	what's a nicer option?
2012-12-20 22:48:53	tangentstorm	project -> options -> parsing -> include assertion code
2012-12-20 22:49:10	tangentstorm	you can change between debug and release options if you prefer it not to be in the executable
2012-12-20 22:49:28	tangentstorm	but i usually just leave the debug stuff in, in case a user has a problem... especially for anything open source
2012-12-20 22:50:14	carefish	wow, with assertion on it breaks on  captureform.FTP;
2012-12-20 22:50:15	tangentstorm	under "build modes" in that same project options system, you can set up different modes and the settings you make should only affect that particular mode
2012-12-20 22:50:21	tangentstorm	yeah
2012-12-20 22:50:21	carefish	called from mainform
2012-12-20 22:50:22	tangentstorm	think about it
2012-12-20 22:50:35	carefish	capture form hasn't been created yet?
2012-12-20 22:50:43	tangentstorm	why was the breakpoint triggered BEFORE you made the screenshot?
2012-12-20 22:51:03	carefish	no, it created the screenshot just didn't upload it :P
2012-12-20 22:51:14	tangentstorm	really?
2012-12-20 22:51:21	carefish	i abstracted those
2012-12-20 22:51:28	tangentstorm	because for me, the breakpoint triggered on round 2 as soon as i select FTP from the menu
2012-12-20 22:51:29	carefish	screenshot is seperated from ftp upload
2012-12-20 22:51:54	tangentstorm	i made a screenshot, nothing happened... go to make the second one, and it breaks before i can take the screenshot
2012-12-20 22:51:54	carefish	oh wait
2012-12-20 22:51:55	carefish	i saw it incorrectly
2012-12-20 22:51:55	tangentstorm	why? it's uploading the first image now
2012-12-20 22:52:06	carefish	it breaks as soon as i select the menu option
2012-12-20 22:52:14	tangentstorm	yeah :)
2012-12-20 22:52:48	tangentstorm	it's really hard to see past your own assumptions. that's why you assert them.
2012-12-20 22:52:53	carefish	okay, so.. what's happening? why is it dying on captureform.FTP; ?
2012-12-20 22:53:14	tangentstorm	( also why so much documentation sucks. everything seems obvious to the people who made it )
2012-12-20 22:53:15	carefish	how can i figure that out? :O (i've always been struggling with debugging code)
2012-12-20 22:53:54	tangentstorm	this code is being triggered when you use the menu, NOT when you make your selection
2012-12-20 22:54:34	carefish	that means what exactly? because it should break on captureform.show right?
2012-12-20 22:55:04	tangentstorm	carefish: it means you've set your code up to run this upload in the event handler for the menu
2012-12-20 22:55:18	carefish	oh really? :O
2012-12-20 22:55:24	tangentstorm	how else could it happen? :)
2012-12-20 22:55:40	carefish	so all i needed to do was to place the FTP code in the mainform and call it from there?
2012-12-20 22:56:44	tangentstorm	well, if i were designing it, i'd have a non-graphical "uploader" object that sent out progress events
2012-12-20 22:56:53	tangentstorm	and i'd have the progress form listening for those events
2012-12-20 22:57:10	carefish	so a completely seperate unit that handled all the networking stuff?
2012-12-20 22:57:27	tangentstorm	and it would just show itself when it got the "upload started" event, and update on each "progress" event and close on a "done" event
2012-12-20 22:57:45	tangentstorm	yeah, probably
2012-12-20 22:58:14	carefish	okay :) i'll get on with that tomorrow.. gonna try to catch a few hours of sleep before school tomorrow :P
2012-12-20 22:58:40	tangentstorm	probably i'd have an "upload" unit with an abstract_uploader class, and then a bunch of subclasses like ftp_uploader, facebook_uploader, etc

2012-12-21 19:21:40	Swiss__	Been having a problem getting a string to print.  http://pastebin.com/Z7GSp7jj it converts fine then it doesn't print
2012-12-21 19:24:26	@Enalicho	Swiss__: Which line?
2012-12-21 19:24:37	Swiss__	20
2012-12-21 19:24:58	@Enalicho	newDice1..3 are all equal to "" ;)
2012-12-21 19:25:03	@Enalicho	look at line 5
2012-12-21 19:25:12	@Enalicho	now look for a line where you change them from ""
2012-12-21 19:25:13	@Enalicho	:P
2012-12-21 19:25:47	Swiss__	when I run convertDice() shouldn't they change?
2012-12-21 19:26:34	@Enalicho	No - the newDice1..3 you have are inside main. They're different from the ones you have inside the convert methods
2012-12-21 19:27:15	@Enalicho	You probably meant to put line 4 and 5 before line 2?
2012-12-21 19:27:39	Swiss__	Ah
2012-12-21 19:27:41	Swiss__	Makes sense
2012-12-21 19:27:43	Swiss__	Let me try that
2012-12-21 19:27:53	@Enalicho	Then there's a few changes you'll need to do - you don't want to redeclare your newDices inside the convert methods :)
2012-12-21 19:29:35	Swiss__	I'm confused
2012-12-21 19:29:59	biio	unrelated to your question, but you could simplify it a lot if you changed convertDice so it took in the die it should change instead of having a method for each die
2012-12-21 19:30:23	Swiss__	So, within the convertDice() I'm declaring that string is a certain face card
2012-12-21 19:30:43	Swiss__	@biio I agree, I'm just trying to be really methodical and have everything seperate for now
2012-12-21 19:31:13	biio	I can fully understand that
2012-12-21 19:31:27	@Enalicho	Yeah - you're declaring a new variable called newDice1 inside the convertDice. This is different from the one inside main.
2012-12-21 19:31:42	Swiss__	Is there anyway to have the variable be available to both?
2012-12-21 19:31:48	@Enalicho	So when you move the declaration outside of the main method and as a property of the class
2012-12-21 19:32:01	@Enalicho	it is then available through all the methods of that class
2012-12-21 19:32:09	@Enalicho	(provided they're not static)

2012-12-23 19:52:49	Amadiro	the subreddit is fine for me too.
2012-12-23 19:53:23	Amadiro	ah, yeah, typo strikes again
2012-12-23 19:53:23	@chance	yeah im just retarded
2012-12-23 19:54:04	Amadiro	hm, somehow my linear interpolation is very unstable and makes my triangles flip out, I wonder what's going on
2012-12-23 19:54:36	@chance	lol, for what?
2012-12-23 19:56:04	Amadiro	interpolating objects on the screen between physics timesteps
2012-12-23 19:57:53	Amadiro	Ah, no, it's actually correct the way it is -- the rest-frametime was just fluctuating
2012-12-23 19:58:51	carefish	also, C# has Dictionairy<T, T>, what's the C++ equivalent?
2012-12-23 19:59:18	carefish	hashmap?
2012-12-23 19:59:18	Amadiro	carefish, depends on what Dictionary is in C# exactly
2012-12-23 20:00:11	Amadiro	or, probably simpler, what do you want from it
2012-12-23 20:00:11	carefish	well, i want to re-write an old piece of C# code to C++ :)
2012-12-23 20:00:33	Amadiro	carefish, well, have a look at http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container or so
2012-12-23 20:00:52	carefish	current code keeps all instances of textures in a dictionary, so i can easily add/find them/not having to reload them everytime a level changes
2012-12-23 20:01:26	Amadiro	map might be what you want, then
2012-12-23 20:02:52	carefish	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xfhwa508.aspx
2012-12-23 20:03:26	carefish	i'll have to double check w/ my C++ book, i believe it had a nice table for that
2012-12-23 20:06:11	carefish	unordered_map is what i want  ithink
2012-12-23 20:09:29	Amadiro	carefish, not a whole lot of difference between unordered_map and map, but unordered_map may perform better if you have massive amounts of textures you need to look up (since it's implemented with an actual hashing mechanism) -- but you'd have to benchmark, for smaller numbers of textures, map is probably faster.
2012-12-23 20:16:01	carefish	i'll just use unordered for now, once the game is done i'll try it out :)
2012-12-23 20:16:01	@chance	ordered_map is just an array with each key mapping to an index, right?
2012-12-23 20:16:01	@chance	err normal map
2012-12-23 20:16:47	@chance	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3902644/choosing-between-stdmap-and-stdunordered-map
2012-12-23 20:16:48	@chance	:D
2012-12-23 20:17:22	Amadiro	chance, how they are implemented is not actually specified, but typically ordered_map is a tree
2012-12-23 20:18:32	Amadiro	remember though that log(n) is still really really good, and "map" might have less overhead, so even though its asymptotic complexity is worse, if you have few elements, it might perform better.
2012-12-23 20:19:58	@chance	yeah
2012-12-23 20:19:58	@chance	log(n) is good
2012-12-23 20:19:58	carefish	i'll go with map then :)
2012-12-23 20:20:02	carefish	thanks for both links :D
2012-12-23 20:20:07	Amadiro	Well, as I said, benchmark it and see
2012-12-23 20:20:18	Amadiro	it depends on the implementation, so I might as well be wrong
2012-12-23 20:20:32	Amadiro	if you really care that much, that is
2012-12-23 20:20:52	Amadiro	if you don't do that many lookups, just go with whatever
2012-12-23 20:20:52	carefish	nah, it's gonna be like < 256 items big
2012-12-23 20:21:11	carefish	but i wanted the ability to use strings as keys :)
2012-12-23 20:21:11	Amadiro	well, my bet would then be that linear search through an array performs best, then map, then unordered_map
2012-12-23 20:21:35	Amadiro	linear search through an array that few elements tends to perform really well if the whole array fits into cache
2012-12-23 20:22:54	carefish	i don't need to search for items, already know where they are due to the strings
2012-12-23 20:23:29	Amadiro	carefish, well, the map/unordered_map still has to "search" for them.
2012-12-23 20:23:57	carefish	oh.. yeah, d'oh..
2012-12-23 20:26:34	@chance	also
2012-12-23 20:26:39	@chance	you can just use an array
2012-12-23 20:26:51	@chance	and constants marking each index
2012-12-23 20:26:53	@chance	and the constants are easy to use keys
2012-12-23 20:26:58	@chance	thats the C way xD
2012-12-23 20:30:32	@chance	i just realized ive been a redditor for 1 year 8 months

2012-12-27 01:38:30	Moopington	I did that
2012-12-27 01:38:44	@chance	oh i see i missed one of your sentences
2012-12-27 01:38:47	@chance	sorry
2012-12-27 01:38:55	@chance	yeah, use the formatting
2012-12-27 01:38:57	Moopington	np
2012-12-27 01:39:07	@chance	Datsundere: in that case it is string formating, my bad.
2012-12-27 01:39:43	Datsundere	its all good
2012-12-27 01:39:45	Datsundere	:3
2012-12-27 01:40:10	@chance	Moopington: also , I know this is for your learning, but for the future, python has an interpreter, which acts as a calculator just fine :D
2012-12-27 01:40:25	Moopington	yeah, ik
2012-12-27 01:40:36	@chance	you can also use python -c "1 + 2" and it'll run skipping the step of intering the interpreter first
2012-12-27 01:40:39	@chance	:D
2012-12-27 01:40:52	Moopington	Didn't know that. :P
2012-12-27 01:41:07	devdude	hey, anybody work on those problems at projecteuler.net? i found out about them a few days ago
2012-12-27 01:41:14	@chance	s/intering/entering/
2012-12-27 01:41:14	hamper2	chance actually meant: you can also use python -c "1 + 2" and it'll run skipping the step of entering the interpreter first

2012-12-27 01:41:37	@chance	devdude: i used to, i dont really like it because its more about being good at math and algorithyms than programming
2012-12-27 01:41:54	@chance	which granted, is a great way to improve at those things, but i feel like its not much about programming.
2012-12-27 01:41:55	Datsundere	^ this is where I'm at
2012-12-27 01:42:09	devdude	ha well i'm terrible at math
2012-12-27 01:42:11	Moopington	print '%d' (ans) --> 'str' object is not callable
2012-12-27 01:42:15	Datsundere	algorithm books are either 1. too advanced 2. too booring
2012-12-27 01:42:27	@chance	A lot of those problems require a very good amount of knowledge in either/both of those categories.
2012-12-27 01:42:35	Datsundere	Moopington: just do print "%d" %ans
2012-12-27 01:42:44	tycoon177	Hey! I was wondering if anyone here had any ideas for java projects that take some time and will help me expand my knowledge. Thanks!
2012-12-27 01:42:50	@chance	Moopington: print '%d' % (ans,)
2012-12-27 01:42:54	Moopington	Can you explain why?
2012-12-27 01:42:59	Datsundere	tycoon177: make ircbot in java
2012-12-27 01:43:15	Datsundere	python semantics
2012-12-27 01:43:24	@chance	if its in parens, you need to have a trailing comma (read about python tuples), and you need the % to say your interpolatiing the following object.
2012-12-27 01:43:26	devdude	tycoon177: how about a checkers/chess game
2012-12-27 01:43:34	@chance	Datsundere: i have an IRC bot which people can work on :)
2012-12-27 01:43:34	Moopington	Well, yeah, but what exactly does it do?

2012-12-27 01:43:50	Datsundere	oh nice
2012-12-27 01:43:57	Moopington	the percent in front of ans
2012-12-27 01:44:03	@chance	interpolation
2012-12-27 01:44:07	tycoon177	devdude: What is an irc bot? Sorry for the noob question
2012-12-27 01:44:07	@chance	its like printf in c
2012-12-27 01:44:14	@chance	hamper2: hey
2012-12-27 01:44:14	hamper2	hi chance
2012-12-27 01:44:23	@chance	hamper2: dogs or cats?
2012-12-27 01:44:23	hamper2	chance: cats.

2012-12-27 01:44:39	@chance	s/rly/really
2012-12-27 01:44:41	Datsundere	Moopington: it basically replaces %d with ans

2012-12-27 01:44:48	@chance	s/rly/really/

2012-12-27 01:45:04	hamper2	Sorry, I couldn't match /rlly (good)/.
2012-12-27 01:45:04	Moopington	Ah, that gives me issues too. It still rounds to 3 if the ans is 3.33333
2012-12-27 01:45:07	@chance	urg :\
2012-12-27 01:45:24	@chance	Moopington: you need to do what Datsundere  said

2012-12-27 01:45:34	Moopington	Oh, alright
2012-12-27 01:45:38	@chance	there are different string formatters for different parts
2012-12-27 01:45:42	tycoon177	What does an ircbot do?
2012-12-27 01:45:44	@chance	%f means, this is a float
2012-12-27 01:45:54	@chance	tycoon177: hamper2 is an ircbot, he does stuff

2012-12-27 01:46:18	Moopington	hamper2: dogs or cats?
2012-12-27 01:46:18	hamper2	Moopington: dogs.

2012-12-27 01:46:47	hamper2	chance: No. No, I don't think so.
2012-12-27 01:46:50	@chance	hamper2: you suck.
2012-12-27 01:47:01	@chance	hamper2: do people learn from me?
2012-12-27 01:47:01	hamper2	chance: Without a doubt.
2012-12-27 01:47:08	@chance	well what the fuck then hamper2 ?
2012-12-27 01:47:24	@chance	hamper2: why are you mean?
2012-12-27 01:47:24	hamper2	chance: Without a doubt.
2012-12-27 01:47:26	@chance	hamper2: clearly that was a bad question.
2012-12-27 01:47:28	tycoon177	hamper2: What are you?
2012-12-27 01:47:28	hamper2	tycoon177: I don't know.
2012-12-27 01:48:04	@chance	hamper2: do you like tycoon177 ?
2012-12-27 01:48:04	hamper2	chance: Without a doubt.
2012-12-27 01:48:04	etb	hamper2: Anal?
2012-12-27 01:48:04	hamper2	etb: No. No, I don't think so.
2012-12-27 01:48:11	etb	hm
2012-12-27 01:48:29	tycoon177	hamper2: do you like chance?
2012-12-27 01:48:29	hamper2	tycoon177: I don't know.
2012-12-27 01:49:19	tycoon177	hamper2: Who created you?
2012-12-27 01:49:20	hamper2	tycoon177: Heck yes!
2012-12-27 01:49:35	@chance	basically, an irc bot is a bot which sits in an irc channel, which has features, which are usually unneccessary, but cool to have
2012-12-27 01:49:36	tycoon177	:facepalm:
2012-12-27 01:50:00	@chance	tycoon177: i actually need to make him ignore questions that begin with who and how and such
2012-12-27 01:50:06	@chance	or respond more intelligently
2012-12-27 01:50:22	Moopington	I found a more complicated but more visually pleasing way to do it.
2012-12-27 01:50:22	@chance	hes a bot written by someone I knew from school who works at mozilla now
2012-12-27 01:50:29	@chance	Moopington: lets see it
2012-12-27 01:50:45	tycoon177	chance: Thanks for that! So basically it just sits there and answers things?

2012-12-27 01:51:01	@chance	pmuch
2012-12-27 01:51:14	tycoon177	@chance: Did you write that in java?
2012-12-27 01:51:25	Moopington	I did it no-comment style, sorry about that
2012-12-27 01:51:41	Moopington	shouldn't be terribly difficult to figure out though
2012-12-27 01:51:58	@chance	Moopington: use isinstance
2012-12-27 01:51:59	@chance	you can do like
2012-12-27 01:52:14	@chance	if isinstance(answer, int):
2012-12-27 01:52:23	@chance	it'll return true if its a certain type of object,
2012-12-27 01:52:49	tycoon177	What programming language is hamper2 written in?
2012-12-27 01:53:01	@chance	actually, that wont work, Moopington
2012-12-27 01:53:06	@chance	because your making them all floats.
2012-12-27 01:53:08	Moopington	Yeah
2012-12-27 01:53:16	Moopington	They come in as strings
2012-12-27 01:53:19	@chance	do that check ahead of time.
2012-12-27 01:53:20	Moopington	So I can't really test it that way
2012-12-27 01:53:37	@chance	well actually
2012-12-27 01:53:38	Moopington	Can I?
2012-12-27 01:53:39	@chance	hmm
2012-12-27 01:54:03	@chance	thats fine.
2012-12-27 01:54:08	@chance	the way you did it
2012-12-27 01:54:15	Moopington	:D
2012-12-27 01:54:19	@chance	its not really relevant to the learning

2012-12-27 01:54:51	devdude	awesome.
2012-12-27 01:55:06	Moopington	Is there a better way to implement all of my if statements?
2012-12-27 01:55:18	@chance	Moopington: probably
2012-12-27 01:55:34	@chance	sec.
2012-12-27 01:55:53	Moopington	at first, i just wanted to name each function +() -() etc, and then run sys.argv[2]()
2012-12-27 01:55:57	Moopington	but I figured you couldn't do that
2012-12-27 01:56:02	Moopington	because it would be silly
2012-12-27 01:56:08	<--	tycoon177 (ad1a64d3@gateway/web/freenode/ip.173.26.100.211) has quit (Quit: Page closed)
2012-12-27 01:57:01	@chance	Moopington: make a function that takes the operator, and the 2 numbers, and then have it do the testing
2012-12-27 01:57:19	@chance	Moopington: you can do something like that better using more advanced techniques
2012-12-27 01:58:26	Moopington	Hmm...
2012-12-27 01:58:36	@chance	ill show you how'd do it, basically
2012-12-27 01:58:42	@chance	which isnt the 'advanced' way
2012-12-27 01:59:36	Moopington	I'm just stuck on switching between +,- etc without lots of if statements
2012-12-27 01:59:49	Moopington	the rest of it I think I could manage
2012-12-27 02:00:43	@chance	yeah, i mean
2012-12-27 02:00:55	@chance	there's no case structure in python
2012-12-27 02:01:11	Moopington	cleaned it up a bit. http://pastebin.com/v3ZE91iT

2012-12-27 02:02:25	@chance	usually form the auto indent on a new line
2012-12-27 02:02:53	Moopington	The whitespace is so I can read the code. XD
2012-12-27 02:03:05	@chance	no, i mean trailing whitespace
2012-12-27 02:03:11	Moopington	?
2012-12-27 02:03:14	@chance	let me show you
2012-12-27 02:03:34	Moopington	you mean like lines 29-31

2012-12-27 02:04:03	@chance	orange = whitespace
2012-12-27 02:04:13	@chance	like tabs/spaces
2012-12-27 02:04:26	@chance	also, you should use 4 space tabs, rather than hard tabs
2012-12-27 02:04:31	Moopington	oh. is that bad?
2012-12-27 02:04:35	@chance	your editor can usually be configured to do change that
2012-12-27 02:04:44	@chance	Moopington: yeah, its wasted space in the file, and its annoying.
2012-12-27 02:04:44	Moopington	and why?
2012-12-27 02:05:02	@chance	4 space tabs are easier to deal with imo, its not a 'rule', so much as a common thing
2012-12-27 02:05:41	@chance	4 space tabs means 4 spaces instead of a hard tab (where its just a normal tab)
2012-12-27 02:05:52	@chance	thats configurable in your text editor usually
2012-12-27 02:06:00	Moopington	alright

2012-12-27 02:27:55	Moopington	Well, no multiplication either
2012-12-27 02:27:55	@chance	anyways, you get the idea of your program, move forward :)

2012-12-27 02:30:50	Moopington	is something wrong because of the *?
2012-12-27 02:30:55	@chance	line 17 doesnt have a : at the end
2012-12-27 02:31:37	Moopington	It was working without the :, still giving me the same error with it

2012-12-27 02:31:58	Moopington	I've been running the wrong file
2012-12-27 02:32:17	Moopington	I copied the origoinal one over to a new one to improve on it

2012-12-27 02:34:44	Moopington	If I change the * to an x, it works
2012-12-27 02:34:54	Moopington	but I get an error about converting to an int
2012-12-27 02:35:21	Moopington	because of a "noneType"
2012-12-27 02:35:43	Moopington	and now it magically works
2012-12-27 02:35:48	Moopington	with the x
2012-12-27 02:35:50	Moopington	not the *
2012-12-27 02:36:19	@chance	btw i figured out the formatting
2012-12-27 02:36:44	Moopington	hmm?
2012-12-27 02:37:00	@chance	when printing, use print '%.12' % ans
2012-12-27 02:37:02	@chance	also
2012-12-27 02:37:07	@chance	dont use the word operator
2012-12-27 02:37:12	@chance	its a keyword i think
2012-12-27 02:37:57	@chance	so remove the if int() stuff
2012-12-27 02:38:15	Moopington	switched to operation
2012-12-27 02:38:38	@chance	:)

2012-12-27 02:39:04	@chance	print '%.12g' % ans
2012-12-27 02:39:11	@chance	the g is the 'general' specifier
2012-12-27 02:40:00	Moopington	:D It looks beautiful
2012-12-27 02:40:08	Moopington	what does the .12 do though?

2012-12-27 02:41:15	@chance	ctrl + f, for "General Format'
2012-12-27 02:41:30	@chance	Moopington: yeah, it rounds based on the value specified
2012-12-27 02:41:38	Moopington	Ah
2012-12-27 02:42:50	@chance	the number after the '.' is the number of decimals to keep
2012-12-27 02:43:34	@chance	its the significant digits stuff
2012-12-27 02:44:47	@chance	its sigfigs
2012-12-27 02:44:52	Moopington	.. does python not have an else statement?
2012-12-27 02:45:07	Moopington	actually, i'm probably forgetting :'s again
2012-12-27 02:45:09	@chance	it does.
2012-12-27 02:45:13	@chance	elif for elseif though
2012-12-27 02:45:17	Datsundere	Moopington: you should try some intro to python books to get the syntax down
2012-12-27 02:45:40	Moopington	Yeah, probably..
2012-12-27 02:45:41	Datsundere	those are basic stuff you should be learning yourself

2012-12-27 02:46:18	@chance	:)
2012-12-27 02:46:32	@chance	still have the links I gave you?
2012-12-27 02:46:39	Moopington	Yep, they're bookmarke
2012-12-27 02:46:39	@chance	i wouldnt get too hung up on these small things
2012-12-27 02:46:40	Moopington	d
2012-12-27 02:46:55	@chance	just try to get through them, spend some time on each section, not too little, not too much
2012-12-27 02:47:09	@chance	make sure you understand the stuff
2012-12-27 02:48:02	@chance	on http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ the important sections are 3,4, and 5

2012-12-27 03:37:40	Moopington	^ chance
2012-12-27 03:37:58	@chance	looking :)
2012-12-27 03:38:31	@chance	btw, you can put your text into raw input for it to prompt that
2012-12-27 03:38:32	@chance	like:
2012-12-27 03:38:45	@chance	return raw_input("Hello what is your name?")
2012-12-27 03:38:48	Moopington	Oh, inpu() takes an arg?
2012-12-27 03:38:55	Moopington	Did not know that. Thanks
2012-12-27 03:39:06	@chance	also, you should use elif
2012-12-27 03:39:25	Moopington	You're right
2012-12-27 03:39:31	@chance	using if 3 times, means it evaluates the expression 3 times
2012-12-27 03:39:38	@chance	if you have elif for the other 2
2012-12-27 03:40:04	@chance	then it will short circuit, and only evaluate until it hits a true statement
2012-12-27 03:40:10	Moopington	Didn't see it as too important in this small of a project, but I can see it having speed issues on a bigger scale.
2012-12-27 03:40:14	@chance	or until it exhausts the options
2012-12-27 03:40:30	@chance	looks good otherwise

2012-12-27 03:40:50	Moopington	input() was giving me a headache for a while because it wouldn't take a string
2012-12-27 03:41:00	@chance	i dont think that takes anything maybe
2012-12-27 03:41:10	@chance	nvm it does

2012-12-27 03:41:21	@chance	use raw_input though
2012-12-27 03:41:24	@chance	better.
2012-12-27 03:41:41	@chance	you should also check for empty strings before returning though
2012-12-27 03:41:49	Moopington	I guess because of the eval
2012-12-27 03:42:05	Moopington	I should...
2012-12-27 03:42:49	@chance	btw
2012-12-27 03:42:50	@chance	if your using python 3
2012-12-27 03:42:52	@chance	its just input
2012-12-27 03:43:00	@chance	but python 2.7 theres a difference
2012-12-27 03:43:10	Moopington	Yeah, I think I'm on 2.7

2012-12-27 03:43:57	@chance	mainly because libraries and frameworks arent ready for 3 yet

2012-12-27 03:52:00	Bleh	Hey, I'm a complete beginner to C# and rather than making a post on reddit for this I'll just ask here. What would be the simplest way to store/save a very small amount of data that can be edited and accessed in and outside the program itself (like a text file)? I was looking at XML files but all the code used for that goes way over my ahead, guess I just haven't reached the point where I'd understand that yet.
2012-12-27 03:53:55	Moopington	chance: With the change you suggested and one of my own- http://pastebin.com/nKw3svGk

2012-12-27 03:54:00	Moopington	Bleh-  I'm not sure, sorry.
2012-12-27 03:54:21	@chance	Bleh: what kind of data?
2012-12-27 03:55:01	@chance	Moopington: you can still put a lot of those prints inside your raw_input
2012-12-27 03:55:11	@chance	and you dont have to convert it to a str
2012-12-27 03:55:12	Moopington	Oh, yeah. I didn't do that at all.
2012-12-27 03:55:18	@chance	all stuff in raw_input is already a string
2012-12-27 03:55:28	@chance	you could probably do:
2012-12-27 03:55:42	Moopington	It's 4am here… I think I'm gonna fix that and then get some sleep
2012-12-27 03:55:51	@chance	while len(raw_input("Stuff")) > 0:
2012-12-27 03:55:51	Bleh	chance, just a few small numbers and one or two strings. not much, just need it to be saved for when the program is closed and easily edited or accessed
2012-12-27 03:56:08	@chance	Bleh: use json
2012-12-27 03:56:18	Moopington	> 0 works with a string?
2012-12-27 03:56:26	Moopington	Alright
2012-12-27 03:57:14	@chance	len() is the part
2012-12-27 03:57:20	@chance	and that wont work, because you have to assign it a value
2012-12-27 03:57:21	@chance	so
2012-12-27 03:57:23	@chance	id do this
2012-12-27 03:57:37	@chance	name = raw_input("Whats your name")
2012-12-27 03:58:16	@chance	while len(name) < 1 and name is None:
2012-12-27 03:58:27	@chance	name = raw_input("whats your name")
2012-12-27 03:58:29	@chance	:)
2012-12-27 03:59:05	Moopington	Oh, alright. Why not just do it with ' '?
2012-12-27 03:59:24	@chance	because that means its an empty space
2012-12-27 03:59:38	Moopington	*and without the len
2012-12-27 03:59:43	@chance	and '' is a 0 len string, but a NULL char would break it
2012-12-27 03:59:46	Moopington	Like I did it before
2012-12-27 04:00:30	Moopington	Well, if someone's going to the trouble of putting a NULL char into my guessing game, they can have their blank name. :P
2012-12-27 04:01:00	Moopington	But thank you anyways
2012-12-27 04:01:06	Moopington	I'm just resisting changing it
2012-12-27 04:01:09	Moopington	because I need sleep
2012-12-27 04:01:14	Moopington	night
2012-12-27 04:01:17	@chance	its good practice :)
2012-12-27 04:01:26	@chance	you'll want to know how to check for an empty string like this in the future
2012-12-27 04:01:28	@chance	night ;)
2012-12-27 04:02:55	Moopington	Wait, before I go, can you explain the "and name is None" part?
2012-12-27 04:03:05	Moopington	why do you need that?
2012-12-27 04:07:13	@chance	basically checks for ''

2012-12-27 04:07:38	@chance	'' is a 0 len str
2012-12-27 04:07:53	Moopington	But why is the and there? Couldn't you just do it one way or the other?

2012-12-27 04:08:20	Moopington	I'm wondering why you're using it
2012-12-27 04:08:23	@chance	because you dont want a NULL char, and you dont want it to be empty either.

2012-12-27 04:09:08	Moopington	isn't 'name is None' essentially saying it's a len()==0?
2012-12-27 04:09:15	@chance	no
2012-12-27 04:09:32	@chance	None is the absense of a value

2012-12-27 04:10:15	@chance	im not quite sure, id look online for a better explanation
2012-12-27 04:10:19	@chance	that covers all bases though
2012-12-27 04:10:59	Moopington	you're right. just name is none doesn't cover a blank entry
2012-12-27 04:11:24	@chance	the None covers if no value is there
2012-12-27 04:11:25	@chance	like
2012-12-27 04:11:31	@chance	in this case, idk if it can happen
2012-12-27 04:11:41	@chance	but in other cases, if you parse a value and store it into a string
2012-12-27 04:11:45	@chance	if it never gets there
2012-12-27 04:11:55	@chance	and the variable never gets anything at all, not even a blank entry
2012-12-27 04:12:16	Moopington	It works with or, but not and..
2012-12-27 04:12:49	Moopington	Odd

2012-12-31 13:09:26	tangentstorm	lazarus itself is written with the LCL
2012-12-31 13:10:09	tangentstorm	LCL = lazarus component library... basically, a bunch of wrapper components that adapt each widget set to one standard interface
2012-12-31 13:10:39	tangentstorm	It wasn't too hard to find in lazarus 1.04 but i'm running a few versions behind on this box and can't find it :/

2012-12-31 13:12:50	tangentstorm	that page is talking about laz 9.3.xx too, though, so it's probably a bit out of date... just poke around. you'll find it. :)

2013-01-01 22:23:02	etb	sometimes they're related and belong as separate ifs

2013-01-01 22:24:30	etb	if(a){ print x; } else if(b){ print y; } else { print z; } will only evaluate "b" if "a" turned out to be false, and will only "print z" if both a and b turned out to be false
2013-01-01 22:24:55	etb	however, if(a){ print x; } if(b){ print y; } might possibly print both x and y
2013-01-01 22:25:08	etb	and b will always be evaluated regardless of whether a was true or not
2013-01-01 22:25:33	etb	else if means skipping code, and sometimes it's crucial to do so
2013-01-01 22:27:56	etb	for example, if(ring > 5){ go_to_answering_machine(); ring = 0; } if(ring <= 5){ telephone_ring(); ring++; } is disasterous logic

2013-01-01 22:35:38	jdrobertso	I've got an idea for a learnprogramming project that someone other than me should start.
2013-01-01 22:36:07	jdrobertso	This is the wrong chat for that. Sorry.
2013-01-01 22:39:37	etb	huh?
2013-01-01 22:39:48	jdrobertso	Nothing.
2013-01-01 22:40:01	etb	what's the idea? i want to hear it :)
2013-01-01 22:40:18	carefish	^
2013-01-01 22:40:34	jdrobertso	Well, there's a subsection of learnprogamming called lpmc where projects are presented for new people to work on, so we can understand how open-source projects work.
2013-01-01 22:41:05	jdrobertso	Another group on reddit, /r/shutupandwrite, has an irc chat. I was thinking we could make an irc bot that runs a game.
2013-01-01 22:41:32	jdrobertso	Basically the game would be taking a sentence from each user who opts into the game and compiling them all, in order, into one story and outputting that story to a pastebin or something.
2013-01-01 22:42:05	AlexFZ	Sounds like a cool idea
2013-01-01 22:42:23	AlexFZ	Could implement a moderation system to remove/modify certain lines for users with permission also
2013-01-01 22:42:58	etb	with the command "scratch that"
2013-01-01 22:43:21	AlexFZ	lol
2013-01-01 22:43:29	jdrobertso	hah
2013-01-01 22:43:42	carefish	that's easy to do
2013-01-01 22:43:49	carefish	i could set up a C# irc bot in a few mins
2013-01-01 22:43:56	carefish	like, <5mins?
2013-01-01 22:44:02	AlexFZ	do it
2013-01-01 22:44:02	AlexFZ	go
2013-01-01 22:44:13	carefish	well, the logging part would be nifty to figure out
2013-01-01 22:44:26	carefish	uploading to pastebin wouldn't be too hard too
2013-01-01 22:44:30	carefish	k, gimme a sec :P
2013-01-01 22:44:38	intothev01d_m	we have several irc bots already, just need to add this command/feature to it
2013-01-01 22:44:38	AlexFZ	woo!
2013-01-01 22:45:04	intothev01d_m	https://github.com/LearnProgramming/hamper
2013-01-01 22:45:25	intothev01d_m	thats the current Python irc bot
2013-01-01 22:45:31	carefish	ooh, python
2013-01-01 22:45:34	carefish	haven't done that in ages
2013-01-01 22:45:39	AlexFZ	I remember first getting into programming when I was ~11 by making IRC bots in the "Scripts Editor" window and Notepad lol
2013-01-01 22:45:42	AlexFZ	fun times
2013-01-01 22:45:51	etb	wouldn't need to be pastebin... it could output the raw text to its own server
2013-01-01 22:45:59	carefish	HA! found old code, proof of concept irc bot in C# :p showed a classmate how easy it was to make one
2013-01-01 22:46:01	intothev01d_m	it uses sqlalchemy so you can store whatever you want there, or just directly upload the logs online
2013-01-01 22:46:30	intothev01d_m	i believe it already has logging as well

2013-01-01 23:49:09	@chance`	as you get better, and older it tends to happen more and more
2013-01-01 23:49:11	@chance`	:)
2013-01-01 23:50:56	etb	programming is the game
2013-01-01 23:51:50	CAREFiSH	chance`: i already sorta decided that after this course, i'm going to study game design rather than game development
2013-01-01 23:54:28	@chance`	what do you mean
2013-01-01 23:54:34	@chance`	err
2013-01-01 23:54:47	CAREFiSH	well, in the course/schools/colleges i can choose from here in my country
2013-01-01 23:54:47	@chance`	i suppose i mean, whats the difference?
2013-01-01 23:54:47	CAREFiSH	gamedevelopment != game design
2013-01-01 23:54:58	CAREFiSH	gamedev is alot more programming oriented
2013-01-01 23:54:58	@chance`	right
2013-01-01 23:55:08	CAREFiSH	game design is about what makes a game fun
2013-01-01 23:56:20	@chance`	ah
2013-01-02 00:01:53	CAREFiSH	and i like to make my idea 'visible' so i can show/explain other(/better?) programmers what i want them to make with my idea
2013-01-02 00:16:28	@chance`	so, do you want to be a programmer at all then?
2013-01-02 00:17:48	jdrobertso	You still have to be familiar with programming and scripting to be a level designer
2013-01-02 00:18:26	jdrobertso	You have to be able to script events and stuff. And if you do more stuff with in-depth designing, you need to be more familiar with programming.
2013-01-02 00:19:04	CAREFiSH	chance`: i believe that to be a good game designer you need to be able to atleast prototype your idea on your own :)
2013-01-02 00:19:38	CAREFiSH	because otherwise there will always be a part of the game you 'designed' but someone else 'coded' it that you won't like 'to your liking'
2013-01-02 00:19:39	@chance`	glad, to know you think that way.
2013-01-02 00:20:37	CAREFiSH	and i forgot the buggers name, but he was a famous screenwriter, how to train your dragon was dedicated to that guy, and i was planning on reading his book for story-writing, so i can write a decent enough story
2013-01-02 00:21:12	CAREFiSH	and i can draw/animate my own stuff in Flash already, due to that spritesheet generator using my own anims/graphics shouldn't be too hard once i get my animation code up and running
2013-01-02 00:21:38	CAREFiSH	jdrobertso might know who that guy is

2013-01-02 00:32:30	CAREFiSH	oh, you're doing it in C++/C?
2013-01-02 00:32:40	hg341	yes
2013-01-02 00:32:50	hg341	i found a skeleton and im trying to flesh it out
2013-01-02 00:33:02	hg341	all it could do was connect to a server
2013-01-02 00:33:10	@chance`	you using a C++ irc bot?
2013-01-02 00:33:41	hg_bot	hg341 said "yes"
2013-01-02 00:34:06	hg341	but im doing it for fun only
2013-01-02 00:34:32	@chance`	i consider C decent, but its one of my least favorites sometimes
2013-01-02 00:34:58	CAREFiSH	i'm loving C++/C#/Pascal/JavaScript :P
2013-01-02 00:35:10	CAREFiSH	focussing my attention to those four for now
2013-01-02 00:35:46	hg341	need to learn about threading so i can input on the bots console
2013-01-02 00:35:47	hg341	:I
2013-01-02 00:35:48	jdrobertso	I like python a lot. But I have trouble with it.
2013-01-02 00:36:21	CAREFiSH	lol hg341, you're probably doing it wrong :)
2013-01-02 00:36:35	hg341	doing what wrong?
2013-01-02 00:36:41	CAREFiSH	try std::cin for input :)
2013-01-02 00:36:47	CAREFiSH	std::cin >> buffer
2013-01-02 00:36:59	@chance`	i'm tempted to look at C#, but I never liked java, and I am not a fan of the microsoft tech
2013-01-02 00:37:09	CAREFiSH	C# is awesome chance`
2013-01-02 00:37:13	hg341	but it will freeze the program until you hit enter wont it?
2013-01-02 00:37:18	CAREFiSH	it's so much fun how easy creating a game in XNA is
2013-01-02 00:37:22	CAREFiSH	no?
2013-01-02 00:37:26	CAREFiSH	it shouldn't :)
2013-01-02 00:37:32	<--	Warrick_ (~Warrick@174-24-207-61.tukw.qwest.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2013-01-02 00:37:34	@chance`	i dont really write games ;P
2013-01-02 00:37:53	CAREFiSH	oh
2013-01-02 00:38:00	CAREFiSH	haha
2013-01-02 00:38:00	CAREFiSH	that's just about all i do
2013-01-02 00:38:11	@chance`	im a web dev, and I like to write applications
2013-01-02 00:38:20	CAREFiSH	but XNA gives a nice framework to stay away from winforms :)
2013-01-02 00:38:43	CAREFiSH	then why not fiddle w/ Node.js ?
2013-01-02 00:39:26	CAREFiSH	i'm in the process of making an app framework using the same js engine Node.js uses
2013-01-02 00:39:45	@chance`	i like nodejs
2013-01-02 00:39:50	CAREFiSH	once that's done it's gonna be shit easy to make whatever app :)
2013-01-02 00:39:51	@chance`	im not a big fan of javascript at times though.
2013-01-02 00:39:55	CAREFiSH	oh
2013-01-02 00:39:56	CAREFiSH	why?
2013-01-02 00:40:00	CAREFiSH	javascript is so much lulz
2013-01-02 00:40:06	CAREFiSH	you get away with so much there
2013-01-02 00:40:06	@chance`	because javascript has a lot of flaws.
2013-01-02 00:40:14	CAREFiSH	well, flaws?
2013-01-02 00:40:16	@chance`	and you have to be really good at error checking
2013-01-02 00:40:20	hg341	!msgbuf part #learnporgramming
2013-01-02 00:40:39	hg341	umm...
2013-01-02 00:40:46	@chance`	you need to remember its tendencies are different from other languages.
2013-01-02 00:40:47	CAREFiSH	you need to be good at error checking ever since no IDE has on the fly compilation/telling you what you might be doing wrong
2013-01-02 00:41:01	CAREFiSH	well ok, i give you that
2013-01-02 00:41:10	CAREFiSH	but other than that?
2013-01-02 00:41:10	@chance`	so its easy to forget.
2013-01-02 00:41:18	CAREFiSH	ah, sort-a, yeh
2013-01-02 00:41:19	hg341	!msgbuf part #learnprogramming bye
2013-01-02 00:41:20	<--	hg_bot (~CppBot@70-41-127-38.cust.wildblue.net) has left #learnprogramming ("bye")
2013-01-02 00:41:28	@chance`	other than that, it can be very great.
2013-01-02 00:41:50	@chance`	at other times, i dont like writing is, just because I enjoy python so much :D
2013-01-02 00:42:00	CAREFiSH	heh :)
2013-01-02 00:42:10	CAREFiSH	what i'd love to recreate
2013-01-02 00:42:10	@chance`	its my favorite language :D
2013-01-02 00:42:20	CAREFiSH	is how easy string manipulation is in python
2013-01-02 00:42:50	CAREFiSH	i'd love to have python's string manipulation in C++
2013-01-02 00:43:00	CAREFiSH	buffer[6:]
2013-01-02 00:43:00	hg341	why doesnt c++ support ("stuff here"+string)
2013-01-02 00:43:00	CAREFiSH	buffer[6:1]
2013-01-02 00:43:06	CAREFiSH	it does hg341
2013-01-02 00:43:20	CAREFiSH	"this is a const char* array"
2013-01-02 00:43:20	hg341	it doesnt work for me :I
2013-01-02 00:43:30	CAREFiSH	what's 'string'?
2013-01-02 00:43:40	@chance`	the + is an operator
2013-01-02 00:43:40	CAREFiSH	an std::string?
2013-01-02 00:43:40	@chance`	there are other ways to do it.
2013-01-02 00:43:50	@chance`	plus that type of string formatting is very good
2013-01-02 00:43:51	@chance`	printf is much better
2013-01-02 00:44:00	CAREFiSH	if so: ("stuff here" + string.c_str())
2013-01-02 00:44:10	@chance`	similar to string interpolation in python
2013-01-02 00:44:10	@chance`	better:
2013-01-02 00:44:10	hg341	wait whats c_str()
2013-01-02 00:44:24	CAREFiSH	that returns an std::string as a const char array
2013-01-02 00:44:40	hg341	mmk
2013-01-02 00:44:40	CAREFiSH	so basically you're doing: "stuff here" + "more stuff"
2013-01-02 00:44:42	@chance`	print "some number is: %s!" % myString
2013-01-02 00:45:25	@chance`	or .format()
2013-01-02 00:45:30	CAREFiSH	oh, and std::string.c_str() also nullterminates it, so no need to append '\0'
2013-01-02 00:46:09	CAREFiSH	i am starting to love the STL from C++ though
2013-01-02 00:46:20	@chance`	uh oh..
2013-01-02 00:46:20	CAREFiSH	was writing my own quicksort today
2013-01-02 00:46:32	CAREFiSH	when i saw intellisense std::sort
2013-01-02 00:46:40	CAREFiSH	google'd what the hell it was
2013-01-02 00:46:47	CAREFiSH	apparently that already does a quicksort
2013-01-02 00:46:58	CAREFiSH	so now i'm using that for sorting my gamesprites :P
2013-01-02 00:48:31	biio	so guys, my basics for my irc bot is working now, any thoughts on the code so far? http://www.privatepaste.com/0b7463e509
2013-01-02 00:48:32	hamper2	biio's shortened url is http://bit.ly/VuMN0p
2013-01-02 00:48:40	@chance`	boost has some godo stuff CAREFiSH
2013-01-02 00:48:43	@chance`	idk if it has a sort.
2013-01-02 00:48:53	biio	not really familiar with working with sockets and all that
2013-01-02 00:49:08	CAREFiSH	chance`: i was going to delay using boost for as long as possible, even if it might make my life so much easier
2013-01-02 00:49:22	CAREFiSH	i have a feeling that if i rely on boost too much i get too lazy
2013-01-02 00:49:48	@chance`	do you think you understand the basics of C++?
2013-01-02 00:50:10	CAREFiSH	don't you need to 'new' those writers/readers outside of your trycatch biio?
2013-01-02 00:50:20	@chance`	if so, then learning boost is just one way to get a better idea of how you can use good tools.
2013-01-02 00:50:25	@chance`	CAREFiSH: what?
2013-01-02 00:50:30	CAREFiSH	chance`: not yet, i think about another month or two i will
2013-01-02 00:51:00	CAREFiSH	i don't code in java, so i don't know D:
2013-01-02 00:51:01	biio	CAREFiSH: hm, I don't think so, if socket fails the whole program will shut down regardless
2013-01-02 00:51:21	CAREFiSH	oh nevermind biio
2013-01-02 00:51:35	CAREFiSH	i thought i did it outside the trycatch in C#, apparently i didn't
2013-01-02 00:51:40	hg341	my code is so messy...
2013-01-02 00:51:53	biio	hg341: what are you writing it in?
2013-01-02 00:52:10	hg341	c++
2013-01-02 00:52:40	hg341	http://pastebin.com/AhHfQUHD
2013-01-02 00:53:12	CAREFiSH	chance`: i mean, i have a firm understanding of C++ basics, but i want to know more about certain errors i sometimes get so i can get more experience in solving those so if i encounter them later when i'm gonna use boost, i might be able to 'boost' the 'fix', and i'd feel if i started using boost now i might miss the chance of getting experience in debugging certain bugs when dealing
2013-01-02 00:53:12	CAREFiSH	with raw pointers
2013-01-02 00:54:10	CAREFiSH	your bot is gonna be windows only hg341?
2013-01-02 00:54:10	@chance`	valid
2013-01-02 00:54:20	hg341	yes
2013-01-02 00:54:20	hg341	because im just doing it for fun
2013-01-02 00:54:21	CAREFiSH	if so, because of your <windows> include you can google around for 'raw' winforms code
2013-01-02 00:54:30	hg341	and im not going to be releasing it
2013-01-02 00:54:35	CAREFiSH	and then make an input panel/output panel using winforms for your bot :)
2013-01-02 00:55:01	hg341	ehh most of this is a skeleton bot i found
2013-01-02 00:55:49	CAREFiSH	well, first off: do you have some C++ experience?
2013-01-02 00:56:14	hg341	a few weeks but ive did a course on java (it was sadly a very lacking course)
2013-01-02 00:56:48	CAREFiSH	haha, well.. what's your current problem?
2013-01-02 00:57:06	CAREFiSH	other than messy code, which can be fixed w/ a few enters/tabs here and there, i don't see an issue?
2013-01-02 00:57:20	hg341	error checking and handleing
2013-01-02 00:57:30	hg341	:I
2013-01-02 00:57:41	hg341	ive never used do/try got any good tuts?
2013-01-02 00:58:42	hg341	in the phrase_message function if some one sends just a "!" or "!something" with no leading words
2013-01-02 00:59:21	hg341	it crashs
2013-01-02 01:00:04	CAREFiSH	if(mystr.find("!")) return;
2013-01-02 01:00:40	CAREFiSH	if(mystr.find("!" + makeyourcommandsavariable)) return;
2013-01-02 01:00:40	CAREFiSH	at the beginning
2013-01-02 01:00:50	hg341	it if finds :! it assumes there will be alleast one word after the next space
2013-01-02 01:01:30	CAREFiSH	oh, it's not .find
2013-01-02 01:01:40	hg341	no
2013-01-02 01:04:40	hg341	its an out of range error
2013-01-02 01:04:52	hg341	i was wondering how you could handle that so it wouldnt crash the program
2013-01-02 01:05:10	CAREFiSH	find returned a size_t, hmm if((mystr.substr(0, mystr.find("!") + 1 == ""))) continue;
2013-01-02 01:05:50	CAREFiSH	or try return; instead of continue; unsure which would be appropriate
2013-01-02 01:07:03	CAREFiSH	woops

2013-01-03 02:04:20	tangentstorm	etb : a thought. if you buy my theory about the four data structures (which is basically that you need an automataton with access to those structures in order to implement that kind of program)....
2013-01-03 02:05:59	tangentstorm	... then the outline of the proof that concurrency suffices for all of them is that all those structures are special cases of connected graphs.
2013-01-03 02:06:47	tangentstorm	i'm not sure i believe this yet, but it's kind of interesting...
2013-01-03 02:06:58	tangentstorm	anyway, back to the code :)
2013-01-03 02:07:13	etb	hmm... have you heard of the celestial emporium of benevolent knowledge's taxonomy?
2013-01-03 02:08:02	tangentstorm	i think so :)
2013-01-03 02:08:09	tangentstorm	do i sound like that? :)
2013-01-03 02:10:08	etb	no, it's just that mutual exclusion is essential to fundamentality
2013-01-03 02:10:58	etb	i'm not sure if you can declare things to be fundamental if they are variably made up of each other's parts

2013-01-03 02:20:06	tangentstorm	yeah you make a good point.
2013-01-03 02:20:20	tangentstorm	except there aren't really any fundamentals
2013-01-03 02:20:38	tangentstorm	or rather there isn't really any *one* set of fundamentals
2013-01-03 02:21:11	tangentstorm	that's why you have so many different approaches that are all "turing complete"
2013-01-03 02:21:37	Z_Mass	Is there way to set a std::array's size with a const class member which is initialized by the constructor?
2013-01-03 02:22:08	Z_Mass	I'm getting an error along the lines of invalid use of non-static data member

2013-01-03 02:31:48	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: i don't know how c++ handles it. in modern pascal, all arrays know their bounds and are stored in the array instance
2013-01-03 02:32:11	tangentstorm	but you're trying to use <> which i'm guessing happens at the compilation stage
2013-01-03 02:32:29	tangentstorm	you need to pass the array size in when you specialize the template, not when you instantiate the class
2013-01-03 02:32:55	Z_Mass	std::array is a wrapper around a C style array. It was created to avoid dealing with raw pointers, so I'm guessing making it dynamic would defeat the purpose
2013-01-03 02:32:57	tangentstorm	so it wouldn't be const int... you have to move the <size> out to cover the entire class
2013-01-03 02:33:26	Z_Mass	Hmm.. reason I'm trying to do it through the constructor is I'm loading that variable from a settings file
2013-01-03 02:34:03	tangentstorm	well, you only have a few choices:
2013-01-03 02:34:22	tangentstorm	1. make an array bigger than the biggest option they might put in settings
2013-01-03 02:34:28	Z_Mass	I'll try making it a static const variable. I'm only using this class once for now
2013-01-03 02:34:45	tangentstorm	I don't think that'll work now that i've actually looked at the code.
2013-01-03 02:35:04	tangentstorm	2. recompile the c++ code based on the settings file
2013-01-03 02:35:16	tangentstorm	3. dynamically allocate the memory
2013-01-03 02:35:32	tangentstorm	#2 is probably not a serious solution.
2013-01-03 02:35:47	tangentstorm	#1 is easy if you know the limits
2013-01-03 02:36:16	tangentstorm	otherwise, #3 is pretty much all you can do. (though there's probably an easy way to do it in std:something)
2013-01-03 02:36:20	Z_Mass	I'm using it for a running avg to calculate fps, so it's also used to divide the sum
2013-01-03 02:36:55	Z_Mass	altough it's giving me crazy numbers, so I'm not sure if my fps limiting function or my fps calculation is out of wack :P
2013-01-03 02:37:17	tangentstorm	what are you recording? the number of milliseconds between frames?

2013-01-03 02:40:51	tangentstorm	THE STORY OF REGEXPS
2013-01-03 02:41:21	tangentstorm	Once upon a time, there was a little machine who liked to look at letters.
2013-01-03 02:41:51	tangentstorm	It loved letters so much, it would ride down the street, looking at the letters printed on all the billboards.
2013-01-03 02:42:02	hg341	3am :I
2013-01-03 02:42:29	tangentstorm	You see, his town had a mad graffitti artist who painted one letter on every billboard.
2013-01-03 02:42:43	tangentstorm	<i'm not going to stop... the genie doesn't come out of the bottle> :)

2013-01-03 02:44:40	tangentstorm	Well, one day, the Mommy machine decided she was tired of the little machine getting lost, and so she came up with a way for him to remember how to get places.
2013-01-03 02:45:00	darkf	this is slightly painful man
2013-01-03 02:45:14	tangentstorm	<Hahaha... i have no idea how to tie it in yet either.>
2013-01-03 02:45:24	darkf	and I get the feeling you're only describing recursive backtracking algorithms
2013-01-03 02:45:36	tangentstorm	It can't be recursive because it has no memory.
2013-01-03 02:45:41	tangentstorm	It's a regular expression.
2013-01-03 02:46:00	tangentstorm	If it had memory, it could hold a grammar in its head, save its state, and come back later.
2013-01-03 02:46:03	tangentstorm	Regular expressions can't backtrack.
2013-01-03 02:46:06	darkf	the most popular RE engines use recursive backtracking to implement them
2013-01-03 02:46:12	tangentstorm	His bike was broken, you see.
2013-01-03 02:46:18	darkf	for stuff like backreferencing
2013-01-03 02:46:30	tangentstorm	It would only go forward.
2013-01-03 02:47:10	tangentstorm	Oh... This is a tragic story.
2013-01-03 02:47:38	tangentstorm	Dang. Mom bot was actually kind of evil.
2013-01-03 02:48:21	tangentstorm	See, she knew her kidbots would only move forward. They'd just keep riding their bikes until they made it safely to their destination, or they'd wind up crashing into a wall and dying.
2013-01-03 02:48:35	tangentstorm	So she just made lots of kids.
2013-01-03 02:50:01	tangentstorm	Hrm
2013-01-03 02:50:11	tangentstorm	You don't need backttracking
2013-01-03 02:50:31	tangentstorm	The whole point about regular expressions is that they don't require a stack. You can parse them with a state machine.
2013-01-03 02:50:51	tangentstorm	If they require backtracking, you don't have a regular expression, you have a grammar.

2013-01-03 13:11:33	Amadiro	CAREFiSH, it's a fairly simple theorem that allows you to check (in any number of dimensions) whether two convex shapes overlap
2013-01-03 13:11:55	Amadiro	the catch is that the shape has to be convex, so you have to split up nonconvex shapes until they are convex

2013-01-03 13:21:34	Amadiro	In case you don't know, a shape is convex if you can connect any two points inside the shape with a straight line, without that straight line leaving the shape

2013-01-04 04:03:25	Z_Mass	I'm using it for the timestep for my game
2013-01-04 04:03:49	Z_Mass	I'm guessing it's probably the same, it's a physics equation

2013-01-04 04:09:00	Z_Mass	Well I think I figured out my original question. But looking at this page http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/integration-basics/ in his evaluate function, he sets the derived output to the state velocity. Does that seem right?
2013-01-04 04:09:02	hamper2	Z_Mass's shortened url is http://bit.ly/WhTaRe

2013-01-04 04:15:34	tangentstorm	yes
2013-01-04 04:15:57	tangentstorm	it's not the derived position
2013-01-04 04:16:15	tangentstorm	it's the derivative of the position function
2013-01-04 04:16:18	tangentstorm	like in calculus
2013-01-04 04:16:34	tangentstorm	wait
2013-01-04 04:17:11	tangentstorm	right. the derivative of position is velocity.
2013-01-04 04:17:23	tangentstorm	the derivative of velocity is acceleration.
2013-01-04 04:17:58	Z_Mass	Oh ya good call, I should have read his comments 
2013-01-04 04:18:05	tangentstorm	when you see dx, it usually corresponds to "delta x" in math, which is the change in x
2013-01-04 04:18:51	Z_Mass	It's probably not worth making two seperate structs for that though, is it?
2013-01-04 04:19:14	tangentstorm	it's change in x relative to time...   so on the graph,  x is the vertical axis and t (time) is the horizontal
2013-01-04 04:19:17	Z_Mass	Right now I just have a single State struct with two Vector2D objects I made
2013-01-04 04:20:04	zebbiz	dx/dt=v
2013-01-04 04:20:16	zebbiz	dv/dt =a
2013-01-04 04:21:05	 *	Z_Mass should probably watch some math and physics videos on Khan Academy
2013-01-04 04:21:08	Z_Mass	lol
2013-01-04 04:21:25	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: i think it's just for clarity and type safety. i don't know what the cost of a struct is in c/c++ so i don't know how to answer whether it's worth it :)
2013-01-04 04:21:35	zebbiz	dv/dx * dx/dt = a => d/dx(v^2/2)=a
2013-01-04 04:24:04	tangentstorm	zebbiz : i'm too tired to follow that last step :)
2013-01-04 04:24:54	tangentstorm	i think i've probably forgotten how to multiply fractions. wow.
2013-01-04 04:25:09	zebbiz	Yeah, that one is complicated and too hard to write down using a phone.
2013-01-04 04:25:37	zebbiz	And I also skipped a step.

2013-01-04 04:28:13	tangentstorm	dv*dx/dx*dt -> dv/dt
2013-01-04 04:28:25	tangentstorm	which is acceleration

2013-01-04 04:29:15	@chance`	lols
2013-01-04 04:30:03	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: Am I missing something? In his acceleration function he passes in t+dt but never does anything with it
2013-01-04 04:30:04	tangentstorm	multiply by dt/dt?
2013-01-04 04:31:25	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: which implies that the accelleration doesn't change over time
2013-01-04 04:31:36	tangentstorm	it must be a constant
2013-01-04 04:31:45	tangentstorm	or a bug :)
2013-01-04 04:32:42	Z_Mass	Hmm..
2013-01-04 04:33:23	Z_Mass	"structure your simulation ... completely from inside this method "
2013-01-04 04:33:23	tangentstorm	his use of k means it's probably a constant
2013-01-04 04:33:25	tangentstorm	for his particular simulation

2013-01-04 04:34:35	tangentstorm	okay, well.. you're making a game of some kind, right?
2013-01-04 04:35:01	Z_Mass	I couldn't get an fps cap working originaly, then I kept reading that calling sleep was not a good solution since the thread was not guaranted to wake up right away
2013-01-04 04:35:25	tangentstorm	that makes sense
2013-01-04 04:35:37	Z_Mass	Then I found a few people linking to this guys pages about timestep
2013-01-04 04:35:55	tangentstorm	okay... so first, why are you trying to cap the fps?
2013-01-04 04:36:49	Z_Mass	Well I currently just have an black screen that loops until the quit event is received, and it's using a full core
2013-01-04 04:37:20	tangentstorm	ok
2013-01-04 04:38:25	tangentstorm	in pascal, i used a function called sleep but i don't use threads
2013-01-04 04:38:36	tangentstorm	https://github.com/goldsmile/zgld25/blob/master/zgld25.lpr#L111
2013-01-04 04:38:36	hamper2	tangentstorm's shortened url is http://bit.ly/UKsrQ1
2013-01-04 04:39:33	tangentstorm	it's sleep(millis:cardinal) so i pass millis = naplen = 1000 div maxfps
2013-01-04 04:39:58	tangentstorm	it worked out fine
2013-01-04 04:40:02	Z_Mass	I'm not using threads either, but from what I've read, the call to sleep (sdl's at least) is only a minimum sleep time, so it could sleep longer than desired
2013-01-04 04:40:23	biio	so in java, I'm trying to write a bot that can load classes at will, is there a reason to write a class loader when I could just use Class.forname(classname).newInstance()?
2013-01-04 04:40:33	tangentstorm	perhaps the reason for using dt then is to compensate for this unknown delay...
2013-01-04 04:40:55	tangentstorm	in other words, it's not something you should do instead of sleep, it's an additional thing to do if you do use sleep
2013-01-04 04:41:05	tangentstorm	https://github.com/goldsmile/zgld25/blob/master/zgld25.lpr#L83
2013-01-04 04:41:05	hamper2	tangentstorm's shortened url is http://bit.ly/UKsIm5
2013-01-04 04:41:12	tangentstorm	if you look there, you see i'm also using a dt
2013-01-04 04:41:49	Z_Mass	From what I've read, this is an alternative to sleep http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/

2013-01-04 04:45:25	zebbiz	hi
2013-01-04 04:45:34	Z_Mass	Hey
2013-01-04 04:45:45	parkman47	word
2013-01-04 04:45:55	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: i don't see anywhere in that article where he does anything like a sleep
2013-01-04 04:46:55	parkman47	I posted a self but basically I'm going nuts... I feel like I'm being an idiot but I might be wrong.  I'm trying to dev in C# in sharpdevelop and everything is either not friendly to my IDE/developing a windows app instead of console or it assumes I already know C#... nothing like "Here's a series of tutorials for getting started in making windows apps in sharpdevelop"
2013-01-04 04:48:17	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: That's what I'm saying. This is a method which does not use sleep at all. It collects the extra time instead
2013-01-04 04:48:20	tangentstorm	the closest he comes is the line     while ( accumulator >= dt )  in his last block
2013-01-04 04:49:05	tangentstorm	parkman47: why not use visual c# express?
2013-01-04 04:49:25	parkman47	I was told SharpDevelop was a great and free IDE
2013-01-04 04:49:28	zebbiz	parkman47: have you tried google: c# windows?
2013-01-04 04:49:35	tangentstorm	so is visual c# express :)
2013-01-04 04:49:55	parkman47	zebbiz: yes; that's where I've come up empty
2013-01-04 04:51:35	parkman47	zebbiz: to restate my issue; your question doesn't handle the sharpdevelop aspect
2013-01-04 04:52:55	tangentstorm	parkman47: you can always switch to sharpdevelop later if you really want to, but visual c# express is actually really nice. it's probably one of the nicest development environments i've encountered
2013-01-04 04:53:56	tangentstorm	you wouldn't know what to do with the source to sharpdevelop anyway yet, so it doesn't really matter that it's open source :)
2013-01-04 04:54:00	tangentstorm	you can always switch later
2013-01-04 04:55:11	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: okay, so basically his approach is to just do the infinite loop but only actually trigger the update/redraw after a certain amount of time has passed.
2013-01-04 04:59:48	tangentstorm	i don't really think the call to sleep will will hurt that much on a modern day computer unless the user is running a bunch of other high-priority programs... i'm not sure his way actually eases your cpu usage, either... i suspect it'll be at 100%
2013-01-04 05:01:29	Z_Mass	Hmm.. 
2013-01-04 05:01:39	tangentstorm	either way, you just model it as update( dt )
2013-01-04 05:02:46	tangentstorm	that way if the time between two frames is really long, you can just run the physics (possibly making several calls like he does) and then only draw the final state
2013-01-04 05:03:06	tangentstorm	in other words: you might run the physics for 5 frames, but only draw the last one if there was a particularily long delay
2013-01-04 05:03:26	tangentstorm	i didn't do that in my code but it's probably a good idea
2013-01-04 05:03:35	tangentstorm	that's what his last example does
2013-01-04 05:03:54	Z_Mass	Ya, either way I need to start using dt. My Allegro pong game was just velocity based, and if I made the window smaller, everything still moved the same speed which made it pretty tricky
2013-01-04 05:03:54	tangentstorm	the *only* difference is that you'd add a call to sleep() after render.
2013-01-04 05:04:16	tangentstorm	my brickslayer game didn't use a dt and now runs at like warp speed :D
2013-01-04 05:04:29	Z_Mass	Or it moved quicker, sorry.. I really need some sleep lol
2013-01-04 05:04:38	tangentstorm	i was just learning javascript, not trying to do things the right way
2013-01-04 05:05:06	tangentstorm	http://javascriptgamer.com/brickslayer/  <- way too fast
2013-01-04 05:05:06	hamper2	tangentstorm's shortened url is http://bit.ly/UKuNhT
2013-01-04 05:06:05	Z_Mass	Doesn't work for me, I just get a blank high score window 
2013-01-04 05:07:46	tangentstorm	weak
2013-01-04 05:08:06	tangentstorm	it's not terribly good code anyway. i need to rewrite that thing for modern javascript
2013-01-04 05:08:45	Z_Mass	It may be vimperator giving it a hard time though
2013-01-04 05:08:56	<--	BlueDreams (~matt@24-205-95-34.dhcp.psdn.ca.charter.com) has quit (Quit: BlueDreams)
2013-01-04 05:09:46	tangentstorm	you may have to click the window.. i don't know. click "start building brickslayer"  though to see the code
2013-01-04 05:10:07	tangentstorm	the code itself isn't all that great, but the concepts are pretty much valid
2013-01-04 05:10:53	tangentstorm	not only did i know 0 javascript at the time, but the site is generated from code that was already written, and the way i chopped it up was kind of a mess too. :)
2013-01-04 05:11:26	tangentstorm	actualy, i don't even know why i was showing you this. i read pong and was thinking arkanoid :D
2013-01-04 05:11:31	 *	tangentstorm goes back to work
2013-01-04 05:11:37	<--	parkman47 (601945d9@gateway/web/freenode/ip.96.25.69.217) has quit (Quit: Page closed)
2013-01-04 05:12:11	Z_Mass	Well I'm working towards a breakout clone so it's all good :D
2013-01-04 05:16:57	tangentstorm	i signed up for that "make one game a month in 2013" group... i guess i need to set some time aside to work on one
2013-01-04 05:17:17	tangentstorm	maybe i'll rewrite this one as my first game
2013-01-04 05:18:07	zebbiz	I wish I had time for that challenge.
2013-01-04 05:18:20	Z_Mass	Ya I could never pull that off either
2013-01-04 05:18:40	zebbiz	Too much in school atm.
2013-01-04 05:19:02	zebbiz	I'm behind too, so I need to catch up.
2013-01-04 05:19:30	zebbiz	Otherwise, no 4th year for me.
2013-01-04 05:20:07	tangentstorm	hopefully, the trick is tiny tiny games :)
2013-01-04 05:21:57	zebbiz	Still, I have a lot to learn before being able to make a game.
2013-01-04 05:24:08	<--	jdrobertso (~jdroberts@d27-96-229-128.evv.wideopenwest.com) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2013-01-04 05:24:21	tangentstorm	Usually I try to write some kind of game as my first program in any new language I'm making.
2013-01-04 05:24:37	tangentstorm	I think it's a good way to learn.
2013-01-04 05:25:02	tangentstorm	they don't always come out right though :)
2013-01-04 05:27:30	zebbiz	I have a game idea that requires a lot of math and not so much graphics.
2013-01-04 05:27:47	zebbiz	Just how I like it :)
2013-01-04 05:28:56	tangentstorm	you should make it!
2013-01-04 05:32:36	zebbiz	It needs to calculate the length of a Trajectory of a projectile
2013-01-04 05:33:05	tangentstorm	is it like worms?
2013-01-04 05:33:16	tangentstorm	worms/scorched earth/hedewars?
2013-01-04 05:33:29	zebbiz	No. Single player.
2013-01-04 05:33:36	tangentstorm	i'm trying to bring hedgewars into the lpmc fold.
2013-01-04 05:33:37	zebbiz	Wait a sec.
2013-01-04 05:33:48	zebbiz	Getting a pic.
2013-01-04 05:35:51	zebbiz	http://imgur.com/09wFx
2013-01-04 05:36:50	zebbiz	A simple drawing of a possible first map
2013-01-04 05:37:17	zebbiz	You are made of water.
2013-01-04 05:37:21	tangentstorm	that looks cool
2013-01-04 05:37:33	zebbiz	You use water to attack.
2013-01-04 05:38:00	zebbiz	Wet-o-meter goes down when you attack and when you stay dry.
2013-01-04 05:38:11	tangentstorm	oh :D i thought you were trying to harpoon those little animals
2013-01-04 05:38:46	zebbiz	No, I'm squirting water on that frog thingy
2013-01-04 05:39:32	zebbiz	The archer is there to force the player to stand under the platform and watch the w-o-m go down.
2013-01-04 05:40:31	zebbiz	A chest gives different rewards. Increase you w-o-m, extra points, temp boost and so on.
2013-01-04 05:41:08	tangentstorm	so you have the game worked out, and you seem to know the math
2013-01-04 05:41:12	zebbiz	 You get points when killing enemies but you get more if you finish the map without killing them.
2013-01-04 05:41:29	tangentstorm	so the problem is that you don't know how to express your ideas in code?
2013-01-04 05:41:52	zebbiz	That and time limitations.
2013-01-04 05:42:54	tangentstorm	well, if it's a hobby, the time limitation thing is bogus :)
2013-01-04 05:43:23	zebbiz	School takes all my time. And I need my sleep.
2013-01-04 05:43:26	tangentstorm	you could choose to work on it 5 minutes a week for the next 20 years just for fun if you wanted :)
2013-01-04 05:43:36	zebbiz	lol, yeah.
2013-01-04 05:43:43	tangentstorm	you could have used the time you were talking here to work on it :)
2013-01-04 05:44:02	tangentstorm	i'm just saying. there's time if you really want to do it.
2013-01-04 05:44:27	zebbiz	I am studying.
2013-01-04 05:44:32	tangentstorm	learning to express your ideas in code is harder... you have to learn the concepts and pick a language, etc.
2013-01-04 05:44:51	zebbiz	Sitting on a train atm.
2013-01-04 05:45:13	tangentstorm	what do you study?
2013-01-04 05:45:21	zebbiz	Language: c+m
2013-01-04 05:45:25	zebbiz	c++
2013-01-04 05:45:34	tangentstorm	well
2013-01-04 05:45:37	tangentstorm	:)
2013-01-04 05:45:46	zebbiz	Getting a master in computer science
2013-01-04 05:45:59	zebbiz	Third year now
2013-01-04 05:46:01	tangentstorm	so write a game in c++ to help you study for petes sake :D
2013-01-04 05:46:26	zebbiz	That's the thing. We don't use c++.
2013-01-04 05:46:44	tangentstorm	oh so you're studying but not for school. i misunderstood.
2013-01-04 05:46:53	tangentstorm	what do you use at school?
2013-01-04 05:46:56	zebbiz	And coding isn't what I'm having trouble with.
2013-01-04 05:47:50	zebbiz	C, lisp, java, ada, and more.
2013-01-04 05:48:23	tangentstorm	so you've been studying all these things for three years but you don't know how to make a game yet?
2013-01-04 05:48:28	tangentstorm	i bet you do.
2013-01-04 05:48:29	zebbiz	It's a mess. We have never stuck with a language long enough for it to stick.
2013-01-04 05:49:18	tangentstorm	i bet you already know everything you need to know, but you just haven't organized it in your mind yet.
2013-01-04 05:49:29	zebbiz	Programming has only been like 25%
2013-01-04 05:49:45	tangentstorm	well what have you learned?
2013-01-04 05:51:02	zebbiz	Math, different computer stuff, starting a company, physics, math.
2013-01-04 05:51:14	zebbiz	A lot of math.
2013-01-04 05:51:39	tangentstorm	like what kind of math?
2013-01-04 05:51:58	zebbiz	Well, never said I don't know how to code. I don't know c++
2013-01-04 05:52:07	zebbiz	You name it.
2013-01-04 05:52:13	tangentstorm	game theory
2013-01-04 05:52:24	zebbiz	Not math.
2013-01-04 05:52:29	tangentstorm	game theory is too math
2013-01-04 05:52:37	tangentstorm	it's nothing but math :)
2013-01-04 05:52:43	zebbiz	gotta go.
2013-01-04 05:52:53	zebbiz	changing trains.
2013-01-04 05:52:54	zebbiz	brb
2013-01-04 06:05:24	zebbiz	Back.
2013-01-04 06:06:41	zebbiz	About the math. I can't translate the fields to English.
2013-01-04 06:07:47	tangentstorm	zebbiz: so when you are doing code, are you able to complete the assignments?
2013-01-04 06:08:01	zebbiz	Yes.
2013-01-04 06:08:40	tangentstorm	but you said nothing sticks? so... you write code then forget how it works?
2013-01-04 06:08:44	zebbiz	Given enough time that is.
2013-01-04 06:09:04	zebbiz	Something like that, yes.
2013-01-04 06:10:45	zebbiz	I know the basics, but some things slip my mind.
2013-01-04 06:11:18	tangentstorm	well, me too... :) i'm constantly using references, even for python (which was my main language for 12+ years)
2013-01-04 06:13:29	zebbiz	Aarg! I'm hungry and no food until I get home.
2013-01-04 06:13:36	zebbiz	In about 2h.
2013-01-04 06:13:59	tangentstorm	that's a long train ride!
2013-01-04 06:14:10	zebbiz	Woho! Train is here. Gonna get my seat.
2013-01-04 06:18:31	zebbiz	Nah, was on the first train for 6h.
2013-01-04 06:18:41	zebbiz	Almost there :D
2013-01-04 06:42:59	tangentstorm	zebbiz: so what kind of programs did you write in your assignments?
2013-01-04 06:43:06	tangentstorm	or just what kind of programs have you written?
2013-01-04 06:44:30	zebbiz	I did write a TD in java. However, I only wrote maybe half of the code.
2013-01-04 06:45:00	zebbiz	We had a robot competition where we wrote the code in c.
2013-01-04 06:45:21	tangentstorm	what's a TD?
2013-01-04 06:45:29	zebbiz	Working on a OS in C atm.
2013-01-04 06:45:33	zebbiz	tower defence
2013-01-04 06:46:00	tangentstorm	oh
2013-01-04 06:46:08	zebbiz	Wrote a encryption program in lisp
2013-01-04 06:46:11	<--	hack (~fire@unaffiliated/security) has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2013-01-04 06:46:37	tangentstorm	this is some pretty advanced stuff. if you can do these things you're more than capable of making your game
2013-01-04 06:46:41	zebbiz	Otherwise it's mostly small stuff.
2013-01-04 06:48:27	zebbiz	As I said earlier, it's the time and my nonexistent knowledge of c++ that stops me from putting as much time as I want into making a game.
2013-01-04 06:49:05	tangentstorm	well, you don't have to make it in c++  :)
2013-01-04 06:49:44	zebbiz	That is the language I want to learn though.
2013-01-04 06:49:47	tangentstorm	i bet if you pick a language you're comfortable with, you could have a good chunk of it worked out in this 2 hour train ride
2013-01-04 06:51:21	tangentstorm	really the language doesn't even matter. you can just figure out what ideas need to be there, and then once you have it worked out, you can go look up those things in a c++ reference
2013-01-04 06:52:05	tangentstorm	the main advantage of using a language from the start is that you can get feedback as you go along
2013-01-04 06:52:41	tangentstorm	c++ isn't a terribly good language for feedback. lisp is probably much better in your case
2013-01-04 06:52:51	tangentstorm	of the ones you listed anyway... because it has a repl
2013-01-04 06:53:16	tangentstorm	python and javascript are great too... work your ideas out at the prompt and once you have them working you can always translate it into c++
2013-01-04 06:54:56	zebbiz	Lisp is pure shit when it comes to graphics. C++ feels like a low level language, which is what I'm after.
2013-01-04 06:55:22	tangentstorm	that's silly
2013-01-04 06:55:50	zebbiz	Thinking of reading AI in python though.
2013-01-04 06:56:17	tangentstorm	c++ is very much a low level language, and lisp is a very very high level one, but anything you can do in one you can  do in the other
2013-01-04 06:56:31	Amadiro	C and C++ are generally considered highlevel languages
2013-01-04 06:56:50	Amadiro	but they are very efficient, is probably what you care about
2013-01-04 06:56:51	tangentstorm	... :) ok
2013-01-04 06:57:10	tangentstorm	higher than assembly language or machine code, sure
2013-01-04 06:57:23	zebbiz	Really? Isn't low level closer to hardware?
2013-01-04 06:57:49	Amadiro	well, "close to hardware" is fairly relative
2013-01-04 06:57:52	Amadiro	C and C++ abstract away the hardware for you
2013-01-04 06:58:00	tangentstorm	machine code > assembly > forth > c > c++ > pascal > python > lisp
2013-01-04 06:58:32	Amadiro	hence they are portable (you program for the "C virtual machine" which is then by the compiler mapped to the actual hardware)
2013-01-04 06:58:50	-->	hack (~fire@unaffiliated/security) has joined #learnprogramming
2013-01-04 06:58:58	Amadiro	so the traditional definition of the term "Highlevel language" is defined for such languages
2013-01-04 06:59:41	tangentstorm	it's true... the name "high level" came from the days when the alternative was assembly language, but it's like in art, where the "modern" period is well in the past
2013-01-04 07:00:49	tangentstorm	but i was using it in a less general sense. i just meant lisp is much more abstract than c/c++
2013-01-04 07:00:58	tangentstorm	but anything you do in one you can do in the other
2013-01-04 07:01:36	zebbiz	Yeah, that I know.
2013-01-04 07:01:50	tangentstorm	anyway you can write lisp code to generate your c++ code, so it's pretty trivial to translate them
2013-01-04 07:02:00	tangentstorm	(not so trivial the other way around)
2013-01-04 07:03:12	tangentstorm	naughty dog wrote a lot of their code in lisp... (jak and daxter, uncharted, etc. for playstation)
2013-01-04 07:03:51	zebbiz	Lisp is good when it comes to AI.
2013-01-04 07:04:13	zebbiz	Not much more.
2013-01-04 07:04:33	tangentstorm	you don't understand lisp then :)
2013-01-04 07:04:52	Amadiro	the AI lisp was traditionally used in has fairly little to do with what game developers call "AI", though
2013-01-04 07:04:59	tangentstorm	lisp is just a notation for manipulating abstract syntax trees
2013-01-04 07:04:59	zebbiz	Even my teacher said that lisp is a slow language
2013-01-04 07:05:10	tangentstorm	languages are not slow or fast
2013-01-04 07:05:11	-->	jrex_ (~jrex@pool-173-76-33-88.bstnma.fios.verizon.net) has joined #learnprogramming
2013-01-04 07:05:15	tangentstorm	compiled code is slow or fast
2013-01-04 07:05:27	tangentstorm	algorithms are slow or fast
2013-01-04 07:05:50	tangentstorm	lisp is just a textual notation for trees that uses a lot of parentheses
2013-01-04 07:05:51	Amadiro	lisp, python, lua, ... are all "slow languages"
2013-01-04 07:06:02	Amadiro	due to their inherent unsuitedness to map them to hardware instructions
2013-01-04 07:06:13	tangentstorm	you don't get what i'm saying
2013-01-04 07:06:36	Amadiro	but what usually matters the most for the speed of a language implementation is its age, as they typically get optimized and incoorporate new technologies as they get older
2013-01-04 07:06:50	Amadiro	and there are some lisp implementations that have been around for a long time and are fairly fast
2013-01-04 07:07:24	tangentstorm	what i'm saying is you can write your game in lisp and then translate it to c++ code and compile it with the c++ compiler
2013-01-04 07:07:34	tangentstorm	and it'll be just as fast as any other code you write in c++
2013-01-04 07:07:50	tangentstorm	because you compile it with the c++ compiler
2013-01-04 07:08:11	Amadiro	I'm exclusively talking about using it as an embedded language/stand-alone language.
2013-01-04 07:08:16	tangentstorm	well...
2013-01-04 07:08:23	tangentstorm	okay
2013-01-04 07:08:31	Amadiro	I have no interest in auto-generating C++ in lisp
2013-01-04 07:08:38	Amadiro	Its less work for me to just write the C++ code myself, in that case :)
2013-01-04 07:08:44	tangentstorm	but you know c++ :)
2013-01-04 07:08:53	Amadiro	FSVO "knowing"
2013-01-04 07:09:16	tangentstorm	look... what i'm saying is... here's a guy, zebbiz, who has an idea in his head
2013-01-04 07:09:24	tangentstorm	the task is to get the idea out of his head and into a computer
2013-01-04 07:09:41	tangentstorm	right now the obstacle is that he doesn't understand the language that's at the end of the chain
2013-01-04 07:09:56	tangentstorm	but i'm saying he can just mock up his ideas in lisp in whatever notation occurs to him
2013-01-04 07:10:04	tangentstorm	now the ideas are on the computer and he can interact with them
2013-01-04 07:10:04	zebbiz	And learn a language that is used all over the world.
2013-01-04 07:10:23	Amadiro	sure, but generating C++ code (from whatever representation) is anything but trivial
2013-01-04 07:10:23	tangentstorm	they've only traversed partway to his goal, but they are out of his head
2013-01-04 07:10:41	Amadiro	I'd prefer to just re-write the ideas in C++ afterwards manually over auto-generating it
2013-01-04 07:10:48	Amadiro	even if that means writing them twice
2013-01-04 07:11:07	tangentstorm	that works too i guess, but the computer can do it for you, and i submit that it is trivial
2013-01-04 07:11:11	Amadiro	but the real advantage of using a language like lisp is, IMHO, if you embed it etc to make your engine scriptable
2013-01-04 07:11:31	Amadiro	and then you can easily manipulate all parameters while the game is running, for instance
2013-01-04 07:11:33	tangentstorm	it's no different than using a template engine to generate HTML
2013-01-04 07:11:37	Amadiro	or change major things without recompiling
2013-01-04 07:11:51	tangentstorm	those are pretty awesome things too
2013-01-04 07:12:17	Amadiro	you don't really get that as such from converting your lisp code to C++
2013-01-04 07:12:46	tangentstorm	i wasn't talking about that though.
2013-01-04 07:12:55	tangentstorm	and you *could* get it.
2013-01-04 07:13:19	tangentstorm	you can generate parts of the code in c++ and leave the rest in lisp, as long as there's some way for the two to talk
2013-01-04 07:14:12	Amadiro	yeah, but I just wanted to write a game, not spend 5 years in making a modular compilation system
2013-01-04 07:14:27	tangentstorm	that's why the "smug lisp weenies" are so smug... :) once you have lisp you can have any language you want
2013-01-04 07:14:42	Amadiro	once you have any language, you can have any language you want, really
2013-01-04 07:14:58	tangentstorm	yeah but in lisp you don't really have to work for it
2013-01-04 07:15:31	tangentstorm	because you have a canned reader i mean
2013-01-04 07:15:36	Amadiro	You do still have to work for it, and I personally consider it duplicated work -- sbcl and co already basically "do that" for you
2013-01-04 07:15:51	Amadiro	they can already translate your lisp code to fairly efficient machine code
2013-01-04 07:16:07	tangentstorm	then why did you say lisp was a slow language?
2013-01-04 07:16:16	Amadiro	I said that with quotation marks.
2013-01-04 07:16:29	Amadiro	and also read the few lines I wrote after that
2013-01-04 07:17:30	Amadiro	sbcl & co already map lisp to your hardware about as efficiently as its going to be, if you're going to generate C++ code from some lisp input, you will either have to restrict your lisp-input to be essentially C++ (just a different syntax) or you end up re-implementing something like sbcl
2013-01-04 07:17:47	tangentstorm	yeah
2013-01-04 07:17:52	Amadiro	so I don't think there's really any point to auto-generating C++ -- all the advantages are in just embedding lisp into your engine
2013-01-04 07:19:13	Amadiro	which is -- incidentially -- almost no work at all with something like guile
2013-01-04 07:19:16	tangentstorm	The advantage i'm talking about is that you can express your ideas and manipulate them on a computer, regardless of how well you understand the target language.
2013-01-04 07:19:57	tangentstorm	you don't have to overcome the obstacle of syntax
2013-01-04 07:20:06	tangentstorm	of learning the syntax i mean

2013-01-04 07:20:46	tangentstorm	you can just write whatever code you want, as if the language were custom-made for your brain, and then figure out later how to translate it to the target language
2013-01-04 07:21:12	zebbiz	Pseudo code.
2013-01-04 07:21:27	tangentstorm	yes, like psuedo code except you can execute it and manipulate it on a computer
2013-01-04 07:23:06	zebbiz	tangentstorm: while your points are valid, my goal is to learn c++ by writing a game. Not writing a game in c++.
2013-01-04 07:23:25	Amadiro	tangentstorm, but if your goal is to output the target language in an efficient manner (because you care about speed) then you still basically have to know everything about the target language
2013-01-04 07:23:36	tangentstorm	i personally think lisp is ugly to look at... i'd prefer to have a more block-like syntax or whatever... but in terms of prototyping an idea, it's pretty handy
2013-01-04 07:23:51	Amadiro	because converting lisp to efficient C++ is only a trivial task if you write your lisp code to be essentially C++
2013-01-04 07:24:13	Amadiro	and if you don't care about that... well, just run your lisp code in sbcl, and get it over with. It'll do as good of a job as you're ever going to do
2013-01-04 07:24:16	tangentstorm	Amadiro: yes. you still have to do the work, but you can delay it

2013-01-06 02:27:26	@chance`	liam_: how is it set up now. that would be a good start.
2013-01-06 02:27:56	@chance`	learning CSS would be a good start to making tables look better
2013-01-06 02:28:05	@chance`	boostrap is a good way to get something already working
2013-01-06 02:28:16	liam_	chance`: the first column are categories, so let's say Math, Econ, etc
2013-01-06 02:28:26	liam_	oh, first I should add that I have a LAMP server set up
2013-01-06 02:28:46	liam_	it's a table that has the names and id numbers for a scientific journal
2013-01-06 02:28:56	@chance`	okay
2013-01-06 02:29:16	@chance`	and you want it pretified, you want more spacing between each cell, a better looking header row, maybe no lines?
2013-01-06 02:29:23	@chance`	then that would be CSS.
2013-01-06 02:29:39	liam_	what I want to do is display them in HTML such that each category has a header, then the rows that have that header are displayed in some neat form using HTML, then when I hit a different category (run out of rows in the current category) display some kind of intermission HTML
2013-01-06 02:29:42	liam_	perhaps a picture or something
2013-01-06 02:29:46	liam_	so it would look like
2013-01-06 02:29:51	liam_	CATEGORY1
2013-01-06 02:29:53	liam_	thing1
2013-01-06 02:29:54	liam_	thing2
2013-01-06 02:29:58	liam_	INTERMISSION
2013-01-06 02:30:00	liam_	CATEGORY2
2013-01-06 02:30:06	liam_	thing1
2013-01-06 02:30:06	liam_	thing2
2013-01-06 02:30:06	liam_	thing3
2013-01-06 02:30:06	liam_	etc
2013-01-06 02:30:08	liam_	rinse and repeat
2013-01-06 02:30:16	liam_	right now I just have a giant table
2013-01-06 02:30:26	liam_	I want to also be able to limit how many categories are shown
2013-01-06 02:30:36	liam_	because currently there are hundreds of them in this table
2013-01-06 02:30:37	@chance`	well theres a lot involved here.
2013-01-06 02:30:56	@chance`	are you using php or something to get this data from mysql?
2013-01-06 02:30:56	liam_	well, any help would be appreciated
2013-01-06 02:31:09	liam_	well, I have been told that using a scripting language might be easier
2013-01-06 02:31:20	@chance`	python, ruby are great.
2013-01-06 02:31:29	@chance`	using a framework would make it easier
2013-01-06 02:31:50	@chance`	pythons been pretty used in the scientific research world, its pretty powerful, im sure that ruby is great too though
2013-01-06 02:31:51	@chance`	anyways
2013-01-06 02:32:03	@chance`	you should look into learning a server language, IE: php, python, ruby
2013-01-06 02:32:22	liam_	well, I have already used php and mysql to get this far
2013-01-06 02:32:27	@chance`	okay
2013-01-06 02:32:33	liam_	like I said
2013-01-06 02:32:38	liam_	as of now I have created a table
2013-01-06 02:32:48	liam_	creating the table involved sorts and other things
2013-01-06 02:32:51	@chance`	in the database or on your page?
2013-01-06 02:32:57	liam_	but I am at the point where I want to display the information neatly
2013-01-06 02:33:25	liam_	the table exists in the database
2013-01-06 02:34:04	liam_	I can select * it, but that lacks formatting, doesn't let me put things inbetween changes in the first column, or allow for formatting and pictures
2013-01-06 02:34:18	liam_	and perhaps most importantly
2013-01-06 02:34:26	liam_	I don't want to print the whole table, because it is huge
2013-01-06 02:34:36	@chance`	well that part is called pagination
2013-01-06 02:34:43	@chance`	theres a ton of tutorials online how to do that,
2013-01-06 02:34:53	liam_	right on!
2013-01-06 02:34:56	@chance`	it'll limit your queries, or cache the data so that you dont display all the data at once
2013-01-06 02:35:02	@chance`	http://www.phpfreaks.com/tutorial/basic-pagination
2013-01-06 02:35:03	hamper2	chance`'s shortened url is http://bit.ly/Rzr9Yx
2013-01-06 02:35:05	@chance`	thats an example
2013-01-06 02:35:06	liam_	thing is I am not a coder by trade, so even terminology like that helps since now I know what to look for!
2013-01-06 02:35:16	@chance`	definitely, I can get that
2013-01-06 02:35:31	@chance`	from there, to make your table 'look' better, learn some CSS. Let me explain how this works with HTML
2013-01-06 02:35:46	@chance`	HTML is the structure, its how you logically set blocks of information up in a web page
2013-01-06 02:36:27	@chance`	CSS is short for cascading style sheets, these basically have a system to specify how each element should look
2013-01-06 02:36:39	liam_	right on
2013-01-06 02:36:47	liam_	I have played with HTML before
2013-01-06 02:36:49	@chance`	it says "the background should be black, the text should be white, and the alignment should be to the left
2013-01-06 02:36:55	liam_	so I think I could make it look ugly at the very least
2013-01-06 02:37:04	@chance`	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
2013-01-06 02:37:04	hamper2	chance`'s shortened url is http://mzl.la/Rzrjzh
2013-01-06 02:37:05	@chance`	look at html and css
2013-01-06 02:37:08	liam_	but this pagination thing is EXACTLY what I was looking for
2013-01-06 02:37:29	@chance`	or
2013-01-06 02:37:33	@chance`	http://www.htmldog.com/
2013-01-06 02:37:36	hamper2	chance`'s shortened url is http://bit.ly/Rzro5L
2013-01-06 02:37:51	@chance`	go through its html/css stuff in order, and you'll get a much better idea of how the stuff in html gets presented and layed out
2013-01-06 02:37:59	liam_	brilliant
2013-01-06 02:38:02	liam_	bloody brilliant
2013-01-06 02:38:15	@chance`	im going to spend some time with my gf, just mention my nick if you have questions and when I come back ill see it
2013-01-06 02:38:15	liam_	this is a project more for my learning than anything else
2013-01-06 02:38:22	liam_	so this will definitely give me something to play around with for a while
2013-01-06 02:38:34	liam_	thank you, chance`
2013-01-06 02:38:47	@chance`	totally, just let me know if you have more questions. try to google anything you can though, it's a great skill to learn, and practice :).
2013-01-06 02:39:06	liam_	chance`: definitely, that's how I have gotten this far!

2013-01-06 15:07:36	DoomZero	So I have a function that returns a struct
2013-01-06 15:07:54	-->	n9mtb (~rob@2607:f0d0:2001:6b::2) has joined #learnprogramming
2013-01-06 15:08:11	DoomZero	"currentPlatform = findPlatform(platform, player);"
2013-01-06 15:08:33	DoomZero	"platform_s findPlatform(platform_s platform, player_s player)"
2013-01-06 15:09:27	DoomZero	also, the parameter there, platform, is an array
2013-01-06 15:10:22	DoomZero	I'm receiving an error telling me that findPlatform returns a pointer to a struct
2013-01-06 15:10:43	DoomZero	At least, that's what I've found by googling the error message, which if it helps, is as follows:
2013-01-06 15:10:46	DoomZero	"conversion from 'platform_s*' to non-scalar type 'platform_s' requested"
2013-01-06 15:11:57	DoomZero	So the question in my mind is "How do I get my function to return a non-pointer value"
2013-01-06 15:12:09	FRodrigues	is there a automatic way to save a date that didn't accept stupid numbers like (year=2000,month= -5, day=-5) in java?
2013-01-06 15:13:10	Amadiro	DoomZero, it's not complaining about the return value, its complaining about the array
2013-01-06 15:13:36	Amadiro	you're trying to pass a platform_s* into a platform_s parameter
2013-01-06 15:13:36	DoomZero	ooooooh goooooodddddddd
2013-01-06 15:13:42	 *	DoomZero facepalm
2013-01-06 15:13:48	DoomZero	that makes a lot more sense then
2013-01-06 15:14:40	DoomZero	so then should I change the parameter to say "findPlatform(platform_s *platform, player_s player)"?
2013-01-06 15:15:04	Amadiro	probably
2013-01-06 15:15:11	DoomZero	Nope, didn't work
2013-01-06 15:15:14	Amadiro	but whenever you pass an array into a function, you also want to pass its size into the function
2013-01-06 15:15:14	DoomZero	same error same line
2013-01-06 15:15:26	DoomZero	how would I do that?
2013-01-06 15:15:36	Amadiro	DoomZero, paste whole code & error message to a pastebin
2013-01-06 15:15:45	DoomZero	way ahead of you, already did that
2013-01-06 15:15:46	DoomZero	let me get it
2013-01-06 15:16:24	DoomZero	Do you really need the "whole code", though?
2013-01-06 15:17:04	Amadiro	the more, the better
2013-01-06 15:17:13	Amadiro	otherwise you'll likely leave out a crucial part
2013-01-06 15:17:24	Amadiro	if its too long, shorten it to a test-case
2013-01-06 15:17:27	DoomZero	http://pastebin.com/uEsgS4yM
2013-01-06 15:17:40	DoomZero	I included the call and the function's entirity
2013-01-06 15:18:37	Amadiro	yes, you left out the important bits.
2013-01-06 15:19:08	Amadiro	for instance I do not know of what type "platform" is
2013-01-06 15:19:12	Amadiro	on line 2
2013-01-06 15:20:31	Amadiro	Also, what compiler do you use to compile this and what options do you use
2013-01-06 15:20:52	Amadiro	and which language and language standard revision are you trying to use exactly
2013-01-06 15:21:15	DoomZero	that paste is about an hour outdated, but it's basically not changed since then
2013-01-06 15:21:57	DoomZero	GNU GCC compiler
2013-01-06 15:22:07	DoomZero	and options I really don't know if that's important
2013-01-06 15:23:34	DoomZero	http://pastebin.com/CAKpLLt1
2013-01-06 15:24:40	Amadiro	as I said, the type of your function is wrong
2013-01-06 15:24:52	Amadiro	you are trying to pass a *platform_s object into a platform_s parameter

2013-01-06 15:26:29	Amadiro	aside from that, "*currentPlatform = ..." is also wrong
2013-01-06 15:27:34	Amadiro	also, what is "player_s player(0.0, 400.0); " supposed to be
2013-01-06 15:27:57	DoomZero	yeah, I changed that later.
2013-01-06 15:28:09	DoomZero	the *currentPlatform bit I mean
2013-01-06 15:28:26	Amadiro	well, then post the changed code
2013-01-06 15:28:28	Amadiro	not some old version
2013-01-06 15:28:46	DoomZero	no, it's alright, the change is literally a single character
2013-01-06 15:28:58	Amadiro	no, its not
2013-01-06 15:29:18	Amadiro	there are many other things wrong with the code, but it's not really worth commenting on without seeing more context as well as an updated version
2013-01-06 15:29:31	Amadiro	preferrably upload the whole project to github or so

2013-01-06 15:40:18	DoomZero	Are there any particular things that you want to point out, Amadiro, now that you have the updated version and some more context?
2013-01-06 15:46:28	Amadiro	line 13 to 20 is no language I recognize
2013-01-06 15:46:38	Amadiro	and I'm pretty sure no compiler included in the GCC compiler collection does either
2013-01-06 15:46:58	DoomZero	that is a constructor.
2013-01-06 15:47:04	Amadiro	in what language
2013-01-06 15:47:08	DoomZero	C++.
2013-01-06 15:47:20	Amadiro	gcc is for C, if you're writing C++, you need to use g++
2013-01-06 15:48:11	Amadiro	also, structs are not supposed to have constructors
2013-01-06 15:48:13	Amadiro	classes are
2013-01-06 15:49:28	DoomZero	the constructor works fine.
2013-01-06 15:49:40	Amadiro	I know that
2013-01-06 15:49:48	Amadiro	but its not supposed to be there
2013-01-06 15:49:52	DoomZero	whether it's supposed to or not is of no concern to me while I know it's working.
2013-01-06 15:50:00	DoomZero	and I do know it's working, therefore, no concerns here.
2013-01-06 15:50:08	Amadiro	Well, you won't ever learn anything with that attitude
2013-01-06 15:50:28	hg341	^
2013-01-06 15:50:32	DoomZero	I've learned that structs are not supposed to have constructors.
2013-01-06 15:51:21	DoomZero	I've also learned that they can have constructors without problems occurring.
2013-01-06 15:51:50	Amadiro	if you think you've learned that, you've thought wrong
2013-01-06 15:52:29	DoomZero	also, it appears that the compiler I'm using is MingW g++
2013-01-06 15:52:37	DoomZero	minGW*
2013-01-06 15:53:25	DoomZero	I think the reason I'm not learning anything is because you insist on telling me that I'm not going to learn anything.
2013-01-06 15:53:38	DoomZero	If you told me something else, I might learn from that.
2013-01-06 15:55:36	Amadiro	no, the reason you're not learning anything is that you prefer to waste my time rather than to pick up a C++ book and learn it properly :)
2013-01-06 15:56:15	Amadiro	check out stackoverflow, google and amazon ratings for a good pick, I'm sure you'll find plenty
2013-01-06 15:59:08	DoomZero	If you think it's a waste of your time to help somebody #learnprogramming, then I think it probably would be better to find a better place to #learnprogramming
2013-01-06 16:00:32	Amadiro	And if you prefer to waste peoples time rather than to listen to their advice and #learnprogramming, than I think it probably would be better to find a better place than #learnprogramming

2013-01-06 18:14:41	DoomZero	of course.

2013-01-06 18:18:34	DoomZero	and I am simply unable to comprehend what is happening here that causes such a thing.
2013-01-06 18:19:51	CAREFiSH	printf means it will print formatted strings do std::cout
2013-01-06 18:20:23	CAREFiSH	and %s\n means: string null-terminated
2013-01-06 18:20:34	CAREFiSH	uh.. woops, string and new line
2013-01-06 18:21:04	CAREFiSH	and i thin %3d means 'print a double'
2013-01-06 18:21:37	@chance`	d is any integral value, the 3 means, 3 leading characters
2013-01-06 18:21:47	@chance`	so 1 will be printed as:   1
2013-01-06 18:21:47	@chance`	not the leading spaces
2013-01-06 18:21:52	@chance`	note*
2013-01-06 18:22:12	CAREFiSH	good to know chance` <3
2013-01-06 18:23:05	CAREFiSH	so %5.2f would mean it'd print: "12345.1" ?
2013-01-06 18:23:12	CAREFiSH	ehh
2013-01-06 18:23:13	CAREFiSH	so %5.2f would mean it'd print: "12345.12" ?

2013-01-06 18:43:16	DoomZero	no, the error is definitely the fault of that printf

2013-01-06 18:44:04	@chance`	where does the printf come from? a function?

2013-01-06 18:51:58	tangentstorm	a problem with ASP?
2013-01-06 18:52:00	tangentstorm	:)
2013-01-06 18:52:16	tangentstorm	like the fact that you're using ASP? :D
2013-01-06 18:55:35	tangentstorm	bad guess?
2013-01-06 18:56:39	@chance`	thats never a bad guess.

2013-01-06 19:01:17	tangentstorm	and the tools at the time were all sorts of buggy.

2013-01-06 19:31:46	Kieronboz	im never doing asp
2013-01-06 19:31:48	Kieronboz	or sql
2013-01-06 19:31:49	Kieronboz	ever again
2013-01-06 19:32:25	tangentstorm	ASP.net is actually much nicer, but has a much higher learning curve
2013-01-06 19:32:44	tangentstorm	i dunno man. you have to look at that line
2013-01-06 19:33:35	Kieronboz	the line is just an input type=text, with value set by value="<%response.write(SeatSetRs('sea_ID'))%>"
2013-01-06 19:33:39	Kieronboz	but it aint having any of it
2013-01-06 19:41:56	@intothev01d	it says type mismatch, so you probably have a type problem where it is getting or setting a type that is not expected
2013-01-06 19:42:50	Kieronboz	thing is, i shouldnt need to cast my dims should I
2013-01-06 19:43:17	Kieronboz	so i dont see how theres a mismatch, im just printing a record
2013-01-06 19:43:17	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 19:44:56	@intothev01d	why would it say you have a type mismatch then? thats what you would need to find out

2013-01-06 19:56:27	Kieronboz	now im casting, for no real reason, and its still broken. :s
2013-01-06 20:06:57	tangentstorm	Is that really the right syntax for field access?
2013-01-06 20:07:09	tangentstorm	Shouldn't it be like SeatSetRs["sea_ID"] ?
2013-01-06 20:07:28	tangentstorm	or just SeatSetRS.sea_ID
2013-01-06 20:07:30	Kieronboz	im populating other fields successfully using ()
2013-01-06 20:07:41	Kieronboz	I could be wrong though
2013-01-06 20:07:46	tangentstorm	oh
2013-01-06 20:07:48	tangentstorm	i don't remember
2013-01-06 20:08:07	tangentstorm	is it possible your editor starts numbering at 0 and the engine starts at 1?
2013-01-06 20:08:34	tangentstorm	um
2013-01-06 20:08:34	Kieronboz	could you explain so that if i was mentally retarded i could understand
2013-01-06 20:08:37	Kieronboz	you mean the ID gen?
2013-01-06 20:08:48	tangentstorm	nevermind
2013-01-06 20:08:55	tangentstorm	'  starts a comment
2013-01-06 20:09:13	tangentstorm	use syntax highlighting
2013-01-06 20:09:40	tangentstorm	ok
2013-01-06 20:10:01	tangentstorm	how about you post the actual code instead of making up fake things that can't possibly be the code you're running to post here? :)
2013-01-06 20:10:47	Kieronboz	im not making it up lol, im just trying one thing real quick
2013-01-06 20:10:57	tangentstorm	value="<%response.write(SeatSetRs('sea_ID'))%>"
2013-01-06 20:11:01	tangentstorm	that was the actual, literal code you were running?
2013-01-06 20:11:10	tangentstorm	even though ' is the comment character?
2013-01-06 20:11:33	Kieronboz	well that was one draft, it has since changed when i realized all my code was commented out
2013-01-06 20:11:34	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 20:11:45	tangentstorm	yeah but that wouldn't give you a type error, would it?
2013-01-06 20:11:52	tangentstorm	it would give you a syntax error
2013-01-06 20:12:05	tangentstorm	so you posted an error and then posted some other code that wasn't actually generating the error
2013-01-06 20:12:07	Kieronboz	yeh its gone now
2013-01-06 20:12:17	Kieronboz	it just changed too ""
2013-01-06 20:12:27	tangentstorm	that's not the point! :)
2013-01-06 20:12:57	tangentstorm	"here. I'm going to show you some c++ code. can you use it to help me diagnose the problem in my javascript code?"
2013-01-06 20:13:07	Kieronboz	im tired and angry at my code lol. sorry :P
2013-01-06 20:13:08	tangentstorm	here's the error trace. (shows picture of cat). :)
2013-01-06 20:14:03	tangentstorm	so, calm down, take a walk around the room or whatever, and then try to compose your thoughts
2013-01-06 20:14:25	tangentstorm	often by the time you can put a good question together with the right details the problem will be obvious :)
2013-01-06 20:15:35	Kieronboz	that will mean its later in the evening lol, i must struggle and battle until it works!
2013-01-06 20:15:59	Kieronboz	Ok heres my opening vb https://gist.github.com/bda7daa8a80355f24cc4
2013-01-06 20:16:05	Kieronboz	i made a RS
2013-01-06 20:16:21	Kieronboz	and i want the one value match that comes back under dataname sea_ID
2013-01-06 20:16:33	Kieronboz	then, in the page, i wanna print out that variable
2013-01-06 20:16:34	Kieronboz	simples
2013-01-06 20:18:03	tangentstorm	okay, where is the code for the page? you have to show us the actual code for the whole thing if you want help
2013-01-06 20:18:15	Kieronboz	sorry I was giving you a min :p
2013-01-06 20:18:36	Kieronboz	the area of interest or whole thing?
2013-01-06 20:18:45	tangentstorm	where is the bug?
2013-01-06 20:18:57	Kieronboz	one line
2013-01-06 20:19:00	tangentstorm	really
2013-01-06 20:19:05	tangentstorm	the bug is on that one line
2013-01-06 20:19:19	Kieronboz	well, Im saying it, which is usually an indicator that its wrong
2013-01-06 20:19:24	Kieronboz	but i believe so
2013-01-06 20:19:25	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 20:19:25	tangentstorm	i promise you the bug is nowhere near that line :)
2013-01-06 20:19:35	tangentstorm	wild guess: your recordset is empty
2013-01-06 20:19:47	tangentstorm	because one of the variables you think is in the request is empty
2013-01-06 20:19:51	Kieronboz	hmm never thought about that
2013-01-06 20:20:06	tangentstorm	so your sql statement returns nothing
2013-01-06 20:20:28	tangentstorm	so you're trying to get a field out of an empty row in your record set
2013-01-06 20:20:31	tangentstorm	so you get a typeerrro
2013-01-06 20:20:33	tangentstorm	error
2013-01-06 20:20:49	Kieronboz	ok i can run with that idea
2013-01-06 20:20:52	tangentstorm	:)
2013-01-06 20:21:10	Kieronboz	the first request is seat reference, this is actually set by the onclick we fixed yesterday
2013-01-06 20:21:17	Kieronboz	ill print out firstseat
2013-01-06 20:21:42	tangentstorm	or put an if statement in that checks for .rowCount
2013-01-06 20:21:49	tangentstorm	or just print the rowcount for row
2013-01-06 20:22:01	tangentstorm	(i think it's called rowcount. i forget)
2013-01-06 20:22:31	tangentstorm	it's just a hypothesis. you have to kind of apply the scientific method when you're debugging.
2013-01-06 20:22:56	Kieronboz	sorry I immediately went and printed without looking in irc
2013-01-06 20:23:01	tangentstorm	here's some weird-ass thing happenening on my screen. how would i make that happen if i wanted it to happen?
2013-01-06 20:23:17	Kieronboz	but regardless, both variables printed out data
2013-01-06 20:23:30	tangentstorm	then that's your hypothesis, and you design a quick little experement to test the hypothesis
2013-01-06 20:23:42	Kieronboz	yeah
2013-01-06 20:23:51	<--	craigInnes (~craig@b0fa195e.bb.sky.com) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-01-06 20:24:04	Kieronboz	so the test was wrong, and i still hate everything, lol.
2013-01-06 20:24:09	tangentstorm	okay, so post the *actual* error you're now getting, the *actual* code that's producing it.
2013-01-06 20:24:17	tangentstorm	better yet, put it all in one page to isolate the problem
2013-01-06 20:24:32	tangentstorm	see if you can make it happen in less than 10 lines of source code and *then* post it
2013-01-06 20:25:04	Kieronboz	well it is 1 line that causes it, if i remove this one line it works great

2013-01-06 20:25:11	tangentstorm	like maybe just have the file you posted a minute ago, with the response.write at the bottom
2013-01-06 20:25:25	tangentstorm	and just run that
2013-01-06 20:26:03	tangentstorm	also it might help to print out the sql statement
2013-01-06 20:26:12	Kieronboz	while i like your thinking, if removing the line and it works and adding the line breaks it, doesnt that narrow down which line it is lol
2013-01-06 20:26:27	tangentstorm	no
2013-01-06 20:26:39	tangentstorm	the bug isn't caused by that line
2013-01-06 20:26:50	tangentstorm	the bug is in your thinking about why that line should work
2013-01-06 20:27:05	Kieronboz	did i even show you the line yet? lol
2013-01-06 20:27:08	tangentstorm	something else is wrong in your program that is causing that line that should work to fail
2013-01-06 20:27:21	Kieronboz	ok. lol
2013-01-06 20:27:29	Kieronboz	I have printed out all the variables
2013-01-06 20:27:32	Kieronboz	and the SQL statement
2013-01-06 20:27:52	tangentstorm	and do you get the error?
2013-01-06 20:28:16	Kieronboz	well the error only comes from trying to display the field the statement finds
2013-01-06 20:28:24	Kieronboz	so by showing only the statement- no
2013-01-06 20:28:34	tangentstorm	so reduce your output to just that one statement
2013-01-06 20:30:25	Kieronboz	which statement?
2013-01-06 20:30:29	Kieronboz	just print the sql?
2013-01-06 20:31:19	tangentstorm	you're asserting that there is one statement that is causing a type error, right?
2013-01-06 20:31:40	tangentstorm	it looks like:   <% response.write(SeatSetRs("sea_ID")) %>
2013-01-06 20:31:40	Kieronboz	obviously im wrong lol.
2013-01-06 20:32:01	tangentstorm	though it really can just be   <%= SeatSetRS("sea_ID") %>   :)
2013-01-06 20:32:12	tangentstorm	and that line is triggering an error
2013-01-06 20:32:28	tangentstorm	right?
2013-01-06 20:32:38	Kieronboz	yeah
2013-01-06 20:32:38	tangentstorm	ok
2013-01-06 20:32:54	tangentstorm	so move that one line to the top of the output part
2013-01-06 20:33:01	tangentstorm	and then put  <% response.end %> after it
2013-01-06 20:33:15	tangentstorm	that'll stop all the rest of the code on your page from  running
2013-01-06 20:33:21	tangentstorm	and just print out that one line
2013-01-06 20:33:31	tangentstorm	then the question is: does it still produce the error?
2013-01-06 20:34:06	tangentstorm	if so, you know that the thing that is screwing up is not anywhere in the rest of that output part, and you can safely ignore it
2013-01-06 20:34:28	Kieronboz	yeh the error is still here, just all alone
2013-01-06 20:34:29	tangentstorm	good
2013-01-06 20:34:38	tangentstorm	you've begun to isolate the problem
2013-01-06 20:34:39	tangentstorm	now
2013-01-06 20:34:42	tangentstorm	https://gist.github.com/bda7daa8a80355f24cc4
2013-01-06 20:34:51	tangentstorm	can you put it right after the code here and still get the problem?
2013-01-06 20:35:08	tangentstorm	if so, post it
2013-01-06 20:36:12	tangentstorm	btw, after we work this out you need to learn all about the little bobby tables exploit http://xkcd.com/327/
2013-01-06 20:36:13	hamper2	tangentstorm's shortened url is http://bit.ly/UB0MQP
2013-01-06 20:36:38	Kieronboz	ok it does the error now without loading anything- even style
2013-01-06 20:36:48	tangentstorm	great
2013-01-06 20:37:02	tangentstorm	now print the sql statement right above it
2013-01-06 20:37:19	tangentstorm	don't copy and paste it. move it
2013-01-06 20:37:28	tangentstorm	so you have sql = xxxx
2013-01-06 20:37:28	tangentstorm	and then on the next line
2013-01-06 20:37:34	tangentstorm	whatever.open sql
2013-01-06 20:38:17	tangentstorm	okay
2013-01-06 20:38:17	tangentstorm	i know what the bug is now :)
2013-01-06 20:38:23	Kieronboz	well now its all white
2013-01-06 20:38:26	Kieronboz	and prints the sql
2013-01-06 20:38:31	Kieronboz	with values
2013-01-06 20:38:37	tangentstorm	and did the bug go away?
2013-01-06 20:38:38	@intothev01d	tangentstorm, speaking of bobby tables, someone wrote a piece about how hacking through sql injection is still so easily (mostly because books, tutorials, even classes generally never get in to proper database use procedures)
2013-01-06 20:38:47	Kieronboz	no the bug remains lol
2013-01-06 20:38:48	tangentstorm	intothev01d: yeah :)
2013-01-06 20:38:57	tangentstorm	Kieronboz: did you rename the sql string to SQL?
2013-01-06 20:38:57	Kieronboz	if my puush was working i would show you
2013-01-06 20:39:00	@intothev01d	it does seem they don't stress sequirty enough
2013-01-06 20:39:12	@intothev01d	what the hell is sequirty?
2013-01-06 20:39:13	@intothev01d	lol
2013-01-06 20:39:21	tangentstorm	intothev01d: worse than that, they actively teach the bad behavior :)
2013-01-06 20:39:29	Kieronboz	https://gist.github.com/99ebf018006af07b3edb thats what i did tangentstorm
2013-01-06 20:39:34	@intothev01d	security
2013-01-06 20:39:38	@intothev01d	that's very true
2013-01-06 20:40:00	tangentstorm	Kieronboz: try renaming the string to SQL
2013-01-06 20:40:57	Kieronboz	well now i get type mismatch on the printouts of my old sql string
2013-01-06 20:40:58	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 20:41:05	tangentstorm	oh
2013-01-06 20:41:18	tangentstorm	so when you change the name of a variable, you must have to change all the lines that use that name
2013-01-06 20:41:23	@intothev01d	i have about 1 prof at my university who I would trust to give me the right info about stuff. the rest are questionable about whether or not they're really telling me the right stuff or what they learned or think they know from like a decade ago
2013-01-06 20:41:55	@intothev01d	one of my web teachers still advocates using fucking tables for layout, i mean damn. not since like the 90's
2013-01-06 20:42:00	tangentstorm	Kieronboz: what is the name of the string variable?
2013-01-06 20:42:22	tangentstorm	:) old school
2013-01-06 20:42:28	Kieronboz	well the sql statement is SeatSetRS
2013-01-06 20:42:33	Kieronboz	that one?

2013-01-06 20:43:47	tangentstorm	it's a string
2013-01-06 20:43:51	Kieronboz	ah
2013-01-06 20:44:02	tangentstorm	line 9
2013-01-06 20:44:11	tangentstorm	you create it by concatenating a bunch of smaller strings together
2013-01-06 20:44:34	tangentstorm	then you open the recordset by passing that string to it
2013-01-06 20:44:37	Kieronboz	ah yeah
2013-01-06 20:44:38	tangentstorm	do you see the problem now?
2013-01-06 20:44:41	Kieronboz	nope
2013-01-06 20:44:55	tangentstorm	look at the line with the error
2013-01-06 20:45:15	tangentstorm	SetSetRS("sea_ID")
2013-01-06 20:45:17	tangentstorm	what is the type of that?
2013-01-06 20:45:28	Kieronboz	string?
2013-01-06 20:45:29	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 20:45:33	tangentstorm	okay
2013-01-06 20:45:34	tangentstorm	so...
2013-01-06 20:45:41	tangentstorm	is "Hello world" a string?
2013-01-06 20:45:42	Kieronboz	it doesnt want to be?
2013-01-06 20:45:51	Kieronboz	yeah
2013-01-06 20:45:57	Kieronboz	i feel 6 but this is appropriate
2013-01-06 20:46:02	tangentstorm	is "Hello world"("sea_ID") a string?
2013-01-06 20:46:11	Kieronboz	yes?
2013-01-06 20:46:28	tangentstorm	if you try to print it, what do you think will happen?
2013-01-06 20:46:35	Kieronboz	lord knows
2013-01-06 20:46:36	tangentstorm	(try it and see if you're right)

2013-01-06 20:47:23	Kieronboz	Ok i managed to cock that up somehow
2013-01-06 20:47:34	tangentstorm	really?
2013-01-06 20:47:40	tangentstorm	what happened?
2013-01-06 20:47:48	Kieronboz	im very tired. lol.
2013-01-06 20:47:49	Kieronboz	uh
2013-01-06 20:47:58	Kieronboz	well I tried replacing my other response write
2013-01-06 20:48:00	Kieronboz	with hello
2013-01-06 20:48:08	tangentstorm	that's another good lesson. don't try to program when you're too tired to program :)
2013-01-06 20:48:29	Kieronboz	I absolutely wouldnt if i didnt have too lol
2013-01-06 20:48:29	tangentstorm	and what did it do?
2013-01-06 20:48:36	Kieronboz	it expected a )
2013-01-06 20:48:44	tangentstorm	huh
2013-01-06 20:48:57	tangentstorm	what do the ( ) 's do?
2013-01-06 20:49:26	Kieronboz	they mean
2013-01-06 20:49:27	Kieronboz	data?
2013-01-06 20:49:45	tangentstorm	well.. like field access
2013-01-06 20:50:07	tangentstorm	most languages they're used to group the parameters of a function/method/procedure but in vbscript you don't need parens around the arguments
2013-01-06 20:50:24	tangentstorm	so they get used for indices
2013-01-06 20:50:39	tangentstorm	so you're trying to get the sea_ID field out of the variable
2013-01-06 20:50:48	Kieronboz	yeah
2013-01-06 20:50:57	tangentstorm	(they're also used to group subexpressions, but that's not their role here)
2013-01-06 20:50:59	tangentstorm	okay
2013-01-06 20:51:09	tangentstorm	does a string have a field called sea_ID ?
2013-01-06 20:51:37	Kieronboz	there has been an input box i was sending it too
2013-01-06 20:52:06	tangentstorm	don't worry about that :)
2013-01-06 20:52:08	tangentstorm	does a string have a field called sea_ID ?
2013-01-06 20:52:27	Kieronboz	I dont understand, no it doesnt?
2013-01-06 20:52:29	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 20:52:46	Kieronboz	do you mean generically? or my code
2013-01-06 20:52:55	tangentstorm	so SeatSetRS is a string and strings don't have a field called sea_ID
2013-01-06 20:53:06	tangentstorm	do you understand  what i mean when i use the word string?
2013-01-06 20:53:22	Kieronboz	basically yes
2013-01-06 20:53:23	-->	tanath (~tanath@unaffiliated/tanath) has joined #learnprogramming
2013-01-06 20:53:30	tangentstorm	ok
2013-01-06 20:53:34	tangentstorm	so SeatSetRS is a string and strings don't have a field called sea_ID
2013-01-06 20:53:44	tangentstorm	and ( ) is field access
2013-01-06 20:53:53	tangentstorm	so what does  SeatSetRS(sea_ID) do?
2013-01-06 20:54:01	tangentstorm	so what does  SeatSetRS("sea_ID") do?
2013-01-06 20:54:08	Kieronboz	breaks my code
2013-01-06 20:54:12	Kieronboz	and
2013-01-06 20:54:21	Kieronboz	well returns mismatch
2013-01-06 20:55:01	tangentstorm	SeatSetRS("sea_ID") accesses the field "sea_ID" on the variable SeatSetRS.
2013-01-06 20:55:04	tangentstorm	SeatSetRS is a string.
2013-01-06 20:55:12	tangentstorm	strings do not have a field called "sea_ID"
2013-01-06 20:55:16	Kieronboz	ok so this wont work
2013-01-06 20:55:17	tangentstorm	therefore, what should happen?
2013-01-06 20:55:17	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 20:55:20	Kieronboz	nothin
2013-01-06 20:55:21	Kieronboz	gg
2013-01-06 20:55:23	Kieronboz	nothing*
2013-01-06 20:55:30	tangentstorm	nothing?
2013-01-06 20:55:36	Kieronboz	well it mismatches
2013-01-06 20:55:37	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 20:55:38	tangentstorm	so the system should just silently ignore it?
2013-01-06 20:55:39	tangentstorm	yeah
2013-01-06 20:55:41	tangentstorm	it throws an error.
2013-01-06 20:56:11	tangentstorm	it should probably throw an error that would give you some indication of what's wrong.
2013-01-06 20:56:23	tangentstorm	not just "oh no something is wrong" but the specific thing that is wrong.
2013-01-06 20:56:39	Kieronboz	Yeah type mismatch
2013-01-06 20:56:39	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 20:56:44	tangentstorm	so type mismatch is saying that you're trying to do something with a variable of a type that doesn't support that operation.
2013-01-06 20:57:03	tangentstorm	so when you printed fields out before, how did you do it?
2013-01-06 20:57:19	Kieronboz	the other ones are
2013-01-06 20:57:30	Kieronboz	either requests from previous page
2013-01-06 20:57:33	Kieronboz	or session pulled
2013-01-06 20:57:40	Kieronboz	this is the only one thats generated now
2013-01-06 20:57:44	tangentstorm	but just in general i mean
2013-01-06 20:57:55	tangentstorm	when you were printing out the fields, did the fields come out of a string?
2013-01-06 20:57:58	Kieronboz	<%=request("per_ID")%> like that
2013-01-06 20:58:08	tangentstorm	okay, so the request object has fields.
2013-01-06 20:58:17	tangentstorm	does it have the sea_ID field?
2013-01-06 20:58:42	Kieronboz	well I think it just requests whatever comes through on the form
2013-01-06 20:58:42	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 20:59:06	tangentstorm	yes, the request is an object that has fields corresponding to form variable names and also query string variable names
2013-01-06 20:59:24	tangentstorm	what else has fields?
2013-01-06 20:59:51	Kieronboz	strings?
2013-01-06 20:59:52	Kieronboz	lol

2013-01-06 21:00:36	tangentstorm	do you have any of those lying around?
2013-01-06 21:00:45	Kieronboz	yeah, lol
2013-01-06 21:00:53	tangentstorm	do you understand the problem now? :)
2013-01-06 21:01:16	Kieronboz	I do
2013-01-06 21:01:18	Kieronboz	however
2013-01-06 21:01:26	Kieronboz	i also do not know how to fix it
2013-01-06 21:01:38	Kieronboz	i imagine i need to cast it
2013-01-06 21:01:40	Kieronboz	declare it somehow
2013-01-06 21:01:54	tangentstorm	walk me through the lines of the program
2013-01-06 21:02:10	Kieronboz	code or general?
2013-01-06 21:02:18	tangentstorm	just roughly, what do those first 11 lines do?
2013-01-06 21:02:35	Kieronboz	well i declare the result set
2013-01-06 21:02:50	tangentstorm	where?
2013-01-06 21:02:55	Kieronboz	line 2 lol
2013-01-06 21:03:13	tangentstorm	I thought we agreed that SeatSetRs was a string?
2013-01-06 21:03:23	Kieronboz	oh yeh i forgot
2013-01-06 21:03:31	Kieronboz	(tired)
2013-01-06 21:03:36	Kieronboz	so I dim a string

2013-01-06 21:03:38	Kieronboz	then create a connection to thrus.mdb, using the ace 12 driver
2013-01-06 21:03:43	tangentstorm	maybe you should rename that string to SQL
2013-01-06 21:03:49	tangentstorm	since it contains SQL
2013-01-06 21:03:58	tangentstorm	or query
2013-01-06 21:04:00	tangentstorm	or whatever
2013-01-06 21:04:17	tangentstorm	but okay, go on
2013-01-06 21:04:26	Kieronboz	ok, so ace 12 driver is used
2013-01-06 21:04:40	Kieronboz	then i create a recordset object called thrus
2013-01-06 21:04:50	tangentstorm	you declare a string with a name to confuse you into thinking it's a record set when it's not, then you create an actual recordset with a weird name like thrus
2013-01-06 21:04:50	tangentstorm	ok..
2013-01-06 21:05:00	tangentstorm	then what?
2013-01-06 21:05:21	Kieronboz	lol, then i make a string to run the SQL
2013-01-06 21:05:27	Kieronboz	or the SQL i want to parse with
2013-01-06 21:05:32	tangentstorm	query
2013-01-06 21:05:38	tangentstorm	okay
2013-01-06 21:05:46	Kieronboz	yeah, then I open my recordset, with the query
2013-01-06 21:05:56	--	megha is now known as gia
2013-01-06 21:06:01	tangentstorm	so then where is the data?
2013-01-06 21:06:11	tangentstorm	after the query runs i mean
2013-01-06 21:06:22	Kieronboz	in my query title
2013-01-06 21:06:30	tangentstorm	what
2013-01-06 21:06:30	Kieronboz	SeatSetRs?
2013-01-06 21:06:34	Kieronboz	oh
2013-01-06 21:06:35	Kieronboz	idiot
2013-01-06 21:06:38	Kieronboz	in the record set
2013-01-06 21:06:42	Kieronboz	which i dwindled away
2013-01-06 21:07:03	tangentstorm	this is why you should call the recordset whateverRS and the query string sql so you can tell them apart when you're tired.
2013-01-06 21:07:14	tangentstorm	rs and sql ... my old friends :D
2013-01-06 21:07:44	Kieronboz	lol, yeah ill bare that in mind
2013-01-06 21:07:50	Kieronboz	better naming
2013-01-06 21:07:50	tangentstorm	okay... so the data is in the record set
2013-01-06 21:07:56	tangentstorm	but you're trying to get it out of the string
2013-01-06 21:08:10	Kieronboz	it would appear i am
2013-01-06 21:08:10	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 21:08:25	tangentstorm	so you can fix it now?
2013-01-06 21:08:35	Kieronboz	<%response.write(thrus("sea_ID"))%>
2013-01-06 21:08:38	Kieronboz	something like that?
2013-01-06 21:08:38	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 21:08:43	tangentstorm	sure
2013-01-06 21:08:59	tangentstorm	although i'd use <%= thrus("sea_ID")) %>
2013-01-06 21:09:03	tangentstorm	and i'd rename thrus to rs :)
2013-01-06 21:09:50	Kieronboz	ok I receive an error
2013-01-06 21:10:00	tangentstorm	the same error?
2013-01-06 21:10:01	Kieronboz	nope
2013-01-06 21:10:10	tangentstorm	well that's progress
2013-01-06 21:10:20	Kieronboz	Missing Default Property
2013-01-06 21:10:20	Kieronboz	line 0
2013-01-06 21:10:20	Kieronboz	lol
2013-01-06 21:10:25	Kieronboz	thats wierd, haha.
2013-01-06 21:10:34	tangentstorm	yeah
2013-01-06 21:10:53	tangentstorm	probably it's rs.columns("sea_ID")  or rs.fields("sea_ID")
2013-01-06 21:11:00	tangentstorm	i don't remember
2013-01-06 21:11:10	tangentstorm	if you had a decent editor, you could use intellisense and it would tell you
2013-01-06 21:12:04	tangentstorm	since you don't, you'll have to search online for adodb.recordset

2013-01-06 21:13:16	Kieronboz	ok so whats happening here
2013-01-06 21:13:39	tangentstorm	i believe you need to use rs.fields("sea_ID")
2013-01-06 21:14:10	Kieronboz	hmm that didnt work, nor did columns
2013-01-06 21:14:10	tangentstorm	or
2013-01-06 21:14:20	tangentstorm	sorry
2013-01-06 21:14:23	tangentstorm	the rs is a collection of rows
2013-01-06 21:14:30	tangentstorm	the rows have the fields
2013-01-06 21:14:40	tangentstorm	the rs is a collection of records
2013-01-06 21:14:43	tangentstorm	the records have the fields :)
2013-01-06 21:15:22	Kieronboz	okay not sure which i need haha
2013-01-06 21:15:44	tangentstorm	try rs.Fields("sea_ID").Value
2013-01-06 21:16:20	tangentstorm	i think Fields is the current record, and you use MovePrev and MoveNext to navigate through the set
2013-01-06 21:16:31	Kieronboz	FYI there will only be 1 match
2013-01-06 21:16:34	tangentstorm	yeah, here's an example ehre: http://allenbrowne.com/func-ado.html
2013-01-06 21:16:35	hamper2	tangentstorm's shortened url is http://bit.ly/WB5RqI
2013-01-06 21:16:35	Kieronboz	hm that didnt work
2013-01-06 21:16:46	tangentstorm	yes but it's still a set of one record
2013-01-06 21:17:25	tangentstorm	did it not work because i said rs and you're still calling it  thrus ?
2013-01-06 21:17:36	tangentstorm	is thrus a word in another language that means recordset?
2013-01-06 21:17:50	Kieronboz	no it means Theatres R US
2013-01-06 21:18:00	Kieronboz	but I changed it
2013-01-06 21:18:02	tangentstorm	ok :)
2013-01-06 21:18:48	tangentstorm	you might want to put  Option Explicit
2013-01-06 21:18:52	tangentstorm	at the top of your file
2013-01-06 21:19:15	tangentstorm	i forget what it does exactly, but in general it generates even more error messages
2013-01-06 21:19:40	tangentstorm	ie, points out even more potential problems
2013-01-06 21:19:49	Kieronboz	I added it but now it has an error on Option Explicity

2013-01-06 21:27:51	hamper2	intothev01d's shortened url is http://bit.ly/WB82KR
2013-01-06 21:28:17	tangentstorm	haha :)
2013-01-06 21:28:22	@intothev01d	but why?
2013-01-06 21:28:31	@intothev01d	lol
2013-01-06 21:28:31	tangentstorm	I kind of want to start my course off with a very simple machine like BF but I don't want to call it BF
2013-01-06 21:29:13	@chance`	oh i thouight it was broken
2013-01-06 21:29:21	@chance`	its fine xD
2013-01-06 21:29:24	tangentstorm	he said ok, bye!
2013-01-06 21:29:31	@intothev01d	call it mind meld :D
2013-01-06 21:29:34	tangentstorm	and then it thought he was saying goodbye to a user named ok
2013-01-06 21:29:41	@intothev01d	similar only not as vulgar
2013-01-06 21:29:41	@chance`	oh up there
2013-01-06 21:29:43	@intothev01d	more vulcan actually
2013-01-06 21:29:45	@intothev01d	lol
2013-01-06 21:29:54	tangentstorm	:)
2013-01-06 21:29:58	@chance`	unless I cache active users it can't know that :P
2013-01-06 21:30:11	@chance`	i could ignore okay, bye though
2013-01-06 21:30:41	tangentstorm	i think that's a reasonable thing to do... know who's in the channel or not
2013-01-06 21:30:49	tangentstorm	a lot of bots do the !lastseen thing
2013-01-06 21:30:59	@chance`	not implemented though, but yeah.
2013-01-06 21:31:21	tangentstorm	maybe i'll send a patch after i get to my next milestone here
2013-01-06 21:31:23	@chance`	mk
2013-01-06 21:31:32	@chance`	well i know you can send the '/names' command
2013-01-06 21:31:41	@chance`	and get all the names.
2013-01-06 21:31:51	tangentstorm	i'd love to have a "!tell somebody whatever" for when somebody isn't here
2013-01-06 21:32:32	tangentstorm	it also should check that people are identified by NickServ (have the +i flag set)
2013-01-06 21:32:41	@intothev01d	someone wrote up a messaging command in the old lpmc bot, maybe they would be interesting in updating it for hamper. could make use of sql as well to store stuff
2013-01-06 21:33:11	@chance`	i found a simple way to do it
2013-01-06 21:33:21	@chance`	well to get the names of people in the channel
2013-01-06 21:33:23	tangentstorm	for lpmc in particular it would be nice to have a welcome thing
2013-01-06 21:33:31	@chance`	yeah.
2013-01-06 21:33:36	@chance`	theres a lot that could be done
2013-01-06 21:34:37	tangentstorm	i want to contribute, i'm just trying to get a core part of my app working before i start anything else. really shouldn't even be hanging out on here :)
2013-01-06 21:34:52	@chance`	lol
2013-01-06 21:35:11	@chance`	well i found the proper twisted.irc method

2013-01-06 22:45:33	@chance`	i think i know how id want to add that tangentwork , i looked at a few ways
2013-01-06 22:45:55	@chance`	easiest/best imo is just maintaining a list on a users joins/parts
2013-01-06 22:46:45	hg341	ok so i understand what a union is and what it does
2013-01-06 22:46:50	hg341	but i cant understand why t would be useful
2013-01-06 22:47:45	@chance`	a union gets you the combination of two sets
2013-01-06 22:48:33	@chance`	also, using unions and intersections you can find out what is common between a list, and whats different
2013-01-06 22:48:45	tangentwork	i think he means c unions
2013-01-06 22:49:28	tangentwork	hg341: it's a way to do polymorphism, basically
2013-01-06 22:49:29	hg341	c++
2013-01-06 22:49:45	hg341	hmm
2013-01-06 22:50:57	@chance`	yeah, basically lets you have one union which allows you to represent a variable in multiple actual implementations
2013-01-06 22:52:17	@chance`	so i just made a burger
2013-01-06 22:52:25	@chance`	now i want another burger
2013-01-06 22:52:25	@chance`	>.<
2013-01-06 22:52:35	hg341	was it as awesome as i hope it was?
2013-01-06 22:53:33	@chance`	yeah. thats why #2 might be getting started here soon

2013-01-07 09:11:08	biio	if you watch videos with notch (from Minecraft), he can write code, have it compile, and the game picks up the changes in the code without having to be restarted
2013-01-07 09:11:11	biio	how is that done?
2013-01-07 09:13:11	biio	I should have mentioned that it's in java

2013-01-13 21:34:59	shade34321	I am trying to dynamically allocate an array of structures in c++. I defined my struct up top and in main I created a pointer to the structure, Student *students. After asking the user how many students I tried students = new Student(numStudents);. Yet xcode states there is an error b/c there is no matching constructor for inialization of "Student". What am I missing?
2013-01-13 21:35:27	intothev01d_m	can you post the code somewhere shade34321?
2013-01-13 21:35:38	intothev01d_m	like pastebin.com or ideone.com
2013-01-13 21:35:42	shade34321	intothev01d:  yeah one sec
2013-01-13 21:36:20	shade34321	intothev01d:  http://pastebin.com/tzaexK42
2013-01-13 21:36:32	shade34321	sorry, should of done that first
2013-01-13 21:37:32	carefish	what's a "nicer" way of sanity checking?
2013-01-13 21:37:41	carefish	if(texture != null) dosomething()
2013-01-13 21:37:42	carefish	or
2013-01-13 21:37:56	carefish	if(texture == null) return; ?
2013-01-13 21:38:27	intothev01d_m	you're using parenthesis instead of brackets for your array. what it thinks you're saying is to construct a student with an argument I believe
2013-01-13 21:38:44	shade34321	intothev01d:  oh…oops...thanks!
2013-01-13 21:38:56	shade34321	carefish:  I prefer == null but it depends on the situation
2013-01-13 21:40:44	shade34321	intothev01d:  now it makes sense, I also test it as an int and for int it didn't complain. In my textbook it was using (). does brackets work for both structures and regular variable types, i.e. int, double, etc
2013-01-13 21:41:23	intothev01d_m	not sure what you're asking really?
2013-01-13 21:42:37	intothev01d_m	creating an array of any data type will use brackets
2013-01-13 21:42:43	shade34321	intothev01d:  so say for instance instead of trying to dynamically allocate a structure I was dyamically allocating an array of ints. In my book they use grades = new float(numOfGrades) to do this. Will grades = new float[numOfGrades) work as well or does my book have a typo
2013-01-13 21:43:18	intothev01d_m	I've never seen it done with ( ), the [ ] will work for any data type
2013-01-13 21:43:36	intothev01d_m	test it out and see :D
2013-01-13 21:44:07	shade34321	intothev01d:  I will. Going to finish my hw for my classes first. But if I know brackets always work then I'll just use that
2013-01-13 21:44:07	shade34321	thanks!
2013-01-13 21:44:09	intothev01d_m	np

2013-01-14 11:53:09	zebbiz	I'm following a tutorial atm and something is wrong and I have no idea how to fix it.

2013-01-14 12:06:04	Amadiro	zebbiz, you are getting linker errors
2013-01-14 12:06:26	Amadiro	meaning there is some library or code object that contains function you want to use, but your linker cannot find it (or you didn't specify that it should be there)
2013-01-14 12:07:52	Amadiro	in particular, whatever sf::* is, is missing
2013-01-14 12:10:02	zebbiz	Ok, I solved that problem. Now I get another...
2013-01-14 12:19:09	CAREFiSH	which is?

2013-01-14 12:27:02	zebbiz	So I run debug.
2013-01-14 12:27:26	zebbiz	Seems to be a problem with RenderWindow

2013-01-23 22:17:31	Hundurinn	why is that?
2013-01-23 22:17:31	mchoc	do you really want to `delete[] myArr;` that many times?
2013-01-23 22:18:05	mchoc	and then continue to access elements in it after it's been deleted?
2013-01-23 22:18:25	ziikutv	mchoc: nvm i figured I can do  chosen_coord[0]

2013-01-23 22:24:26	tangentstorm	this.copy() i mean
2013-01-23 22:24:50	mchoc	then it's just a matter of putting the right values into the new matrix and returning the result
2013-01-23 22:24:55	mchoc	then the user has to delete it
2013-01-23 22:25:07	mchoc	which is what makes it wrong (prone to error leak)

2013-01-23 23:54:18	liam_	Hey Everyone, PHP question: Trying to set up a means of cycling through different selects. The idea being that much like pagination, I want next/previous buttons, and each "page" would be a slightly different select function. More specifically I would be changing one variable that I cycle through from a list
2013-01-23 23:58:48	tangentstorm	liam_: ok...
2013-01-24 00:04:49	liam_	tangentstorm: any ideas?
2013-01-24 00:05:34	liam_	I am not a php coder by trade, so I don't know if there is some term I should be knowing for. From the words I know I would describe it as "pagination" using filter
2013-01-24 00:05:40	tangentstorm	liam_: it sounds like a reasonable plan. what is your obstacle?
2013-01-24 00:05:56	liam_	I have no idea how to implement it
2013-01-24 00:06:06	liam_	I can create my list
2013-01-24 00:06:14	liam_	but I have no idea how to set up the "pagination" aspect of it
2013-01-24 00:06:30	liam_	the previos/next/ and inbetween numbers for the pages, etc
2013-01-24 00:06:58	liam_	if this sort of thing has a name, then I could google around and try to figure it out
2013-01-24 00:07:02	liam_	that's how I have gotten this far
2013-01-24 00:07:28	tangentstorm	ok
2013-01-24 00:07:38	tangentstorm	do you know what an array is?
2013-01-24 00:07:45	liam_	yes
2013-01-24 00:08:07	tangentstorm	okay so... create an array containing your sql queries.
2013-01-24 00:08:18	liam_	oh, here's the thing
2013-01-24 00:08:18	tangentstorm	either an array of strings, or an array of functions
2013-01-24 00:08:21	liam_	and maybe I just did not explain it well enough
2013-01-24 00:08:37	liam_	it is the same exact SQL query, except for one variable
2013-01-24 00:08:50	liam_	so imagine those are the first ten letter of the alphabet
2013-01-24 00:08:50	liam_	the first page would be
2013-01-24 00:08:51	tangentstorm	okay
2013-01-24 00:09:04	liam_	select blah blah blah [filter out only the As]
2013-01-24 00:09:05	liam_	and the next page Bs
2013-01-24 00:09:07	liam_	etc
2013-01-24 00:09:10	tangentstorm	are the possibilities fixed?
2013-01-24 00:09:18	tangentstorm	or are they dynamic based on the database?
2013-01-24 00:09:48	liam_	not sure what you mean
2013-01-24 00:09:52	tangentstorm	i mean: is it really the alphabet, one page per letter, or is the number of pages determined dynamically?
2013-01-24 00:09:59	liam_	OH
2013-01-24 00:10:05	tangentstorm	or is it some other fixed set of pages.
2013-01-24 00:10:05	liam_	right
2013-01-24 00:10:18	liam_	for my purposes I will only need 10 pages
2013-01-24 00:10:25	liam_	and the list is created dynamically
2013-01-24 00:10:32	tangentstorm	always exactly 10?
2013-01-24 00:10:39	tangentstorm	not 0..10?
2013-01-24 00:10:48	tangentstorm	or 1..10?
2013-01-24 00:10:48	liam_	10 "pages"
2013-01-24 00:11:03	liam_	I am going to sort a table
2013-01-24 00:11:18	liam_	and then display the top 10 categories on one page each
2013-01-24 00:12:18	tangentstorm	.. i think it may actually be easier to implement a more general approach, but let's see
2013-01-24 00:12:42	tangentstorm	do you already know how to do the sql to sort the table?
2013-01-24 00:12:58	tangentstorm	to figure out which categories are the top categories?
2013-01-24 00:12:58	liam_	yes
2013-01-24 00:13:18	tangentstorm	do you know how to create a view that contains this query?
2013-01-24 00:13:30	liam_	yes
2013-01-24 00:13:48	liam_	right now I am able to display the entire "result"
2013-01-24 00:13:56	liam_	but I want to make it neater, instead of just a giant list
2013-01-24 00:14:05	tangentstorm	do you have a view with 10 rows, with a category_id in each row?
2013-01-24 00:14:05	liam_	well, giant table
2013-01-24 00:14:41	liam_	yes, I generate a table that has the top ten categories in descending order
2013-01-24 00:14:48	liam_	*I can generate
2013-01-24 00:14:51	tangentstorm	ok
2013-01-24 00:15:28	tangentstorm	so now you want to get the nth category_id from this list
2013-01-24 00:16:06	liam_	right, each page is the nth category, being shown by some select function that has a variable that somehow cycles through this list for each page
2013-01-24 00:16:28	liam_	and I know for a fact that I only ever want to show 10 of them
2013-01-24 00:16:28	liam_	ten pages
2013-01-24 00:16:48	liam_	but each "page" will have different numbers of rows, hence why pagination does not work
2013-01-24 00:17:09	liam_	I also want to be able to set up CSS for each of these pages
2013-01-24 00:17:20	liam_	so there are different numbers of rows, but there is a template being used
2013-01-24 00:17:36	tangentstorm	my php is rusty but try     $page =  $_GET['n'] || 0;  if (! is_int( $page )) { status( '404 not found' ); exit(); }
2013-01-24 00:17:36	liam_	and since I don't know what this is called, I have no idea what to google for
2013-01-24 00:19:10	tangentstorm	now you want to run the query: SELECT category_id FROM report ORDER BY score_column LIMIT 1, XXXX
2013-01-24 00:19:30	tangentstorm	where XXX is however you escape query parameters in php
2013-01-24 00:20:18	liam_	hmm
2013-01-24 00:20:23	tangentstorm	http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.bind-param.php
2013-01-24 00:20:24	tamper	tangentstorm's shortened url is http://bit.ly/147wqdZ
2013-01-24 00:20:28	tangentstorm	talking about this
2013-01-24 00:20:41	tangentstorm	so XXX would be  ?
2013-01-24 00:21:18	tangentstorm	whoops
2013-01-24 00:21:28	tangentstorm	" LIMIT 1 OFFSET ? "
2013-01-24 00:21:31	tangentstorm	http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/select.html
2013-01-24 00:21:31	tamper	tangentstorm's shortened url is http://bit.ly/147wwSR
2013-01-24 00:22:36	tangentstorm	now you will either have a single row that contains the category_id for this page, or you will have an empty result set.
2013-01-24 00:22:58	tangentstorm	alternatively, you can select all 10 rows.
2013-01-24 00:23:06	tangentstorm	you might want to do this if you want to show these as tabs with names across the top
2013-01-24 00:23:11	tangentstorm	anyway
2013-01-24 00:23:41	tangentstorm	now you take that category_id and use it to filter the query you already have.
2013-01-24 00:24:36	liam_	I think I see what you mean
2013-01-24 00:24:55	tangentstorm	for the navigation, you can do something like   for ( $i = 0; i < 10 ; $++i ) { if ($i==$page) { show_current_tab; } else { show_link } }
2013-01-24 00:24:57	tangentstorm	or whatever
2013-01-24 00:25:18	tangentstorm	with ()'s obviously... sorry. gotten comfortable with pascal :)
2013-01-24 00:25:28	liam_	oh, no worries at all
2013-01-24 00:25:59	liam_	would you happen to know if there is a name for this? since I am not a php coder I have found that I learn better from examples, so I would love to google something even slightly similar
2013-01-24 00:26:29	tangentstorm	actually probably it's show_link( $n ) { blahblahblah(); echo '<a href="whatever.php?n=$n>$n</a>'; }
2013-01-24 00:26:56	tangentstorm	this ?n=4 shows up in the $_GET['n'] of course.
2013-01-24 00:26:59	tangentstorm	so it's all one page.
2013-01-24 00:27:28	carefish	okay!
2013-01-24 00:27:54	carefish	so here's my game i have to show in a few hours: www.is1337.eu/rekendoodle
2013-01-24 00:27:58	tamper	carefish's shortened url is http://bit.ly/147xr5I
2013-01-24 00:27:58	tangentstorm	if you want different CSS or want to include names, then you put those in the table, and instead of ( $i < 10 ) in your for loop, you'd loop through the record set and just keep count manually with $i = 0 at the top and $i++ inside the loop.
2013-01-24 00:28:18	carefish	A/D is switch modifier/math sign
2013-01-24 00:28:28	carefish	arrow keys left and right move the player

2013-02-01 17:17:16	ditoa	Which language would be best to start with for a total beginner; C++ or Java?
2013-02-01 17:21:41	biio	I am not the best one the answer that, but in my own personal oppinion, Java is a lot smoother to write
2013-02-01 17:22:31	ditoa	Yeah I wasn't really considering Java but I got a free license of IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains so I thought I might make use of it :)
2013-02-01 17:23:12	@intothev01d	+1 for intellij
2013-02-01 17:24:02	ditoa	obviously it is a bit advanced for me now so I will stick to sublime text for now but it is nice to have a high quality IDE to move too when the time is right
2013-02-01 17:24:53	mutes	how much of a beginner are you ditoa
2013-02-01 17:25:31	mutes	like, what concepts are you familiar with in programming, if any
2013-02-01 17:25:39	ditoa	I have done quite a lot of VBA/VBScript in the past (Excel macros and some admin scripts for windows server to automate some things via WBEM)
2013-02-01 17:26:40	ditoa	I also did C for about 6 months in early 2002, got as far as reading and writing files so I understand the concepts of functions, loops, basic interation, etc
2013-02-01 17:26:53	mutes	might as well do c++
2013-02-01 17:27:59	ditoa	I was thinking of picking up Bjarne's Programming Principles from my local library (it is the only C++ book they have other than Learn C++ in 21 days, etc)
2013-02-01 17:28:43	ditoa	the Bjarne book seems to get good reviews and is a general intro to programming aimed at beginners it just happens to use C++ as the language to teach one to program rather than be a dedicated learn C++ book
2013-02-01 17:39:06	mutes	jumping into C++ is a good one ditoa, and mirrored in various places
2013-02-01 17:47:20	ditoa	have you got a link mutes?
2013-02-01 17:48:27	ditoa	Do you think the Bjarne book would be worth getting as well?
2013-02-01 17:49:25	ditoa	I have read good things about C++ Primer which a friend has (not the latest edition that covers C++11 the version before that) and Accelerated C++ but that seems aimed more towards people who are already quite versed with other programming languages rather than aimed at a total beginner
2013-02-01 17:50:14	ditoa	I can write a for or while loop just fine and have a basic understanding of pass by reference vs pass by value but I still consider myself a total noob :)
2013-02-01 17:50:25	mutes	if you understand methods and functions then you should be fine
2013-02-01 17:50:46	mutes	i skimmed bjarnes book to be honest
2013-02-01 17:51:07	ditoa	I see the terms methods and functions used interchangeably. do they actually mean the same thing?
2013-02-01 17:51:26	mutes	any dummies book that teaches you about classes and inheritance should be simple enough to grok
2013-02-01 17:51:30	mutes	methods are uh
2013-02-01 17:51:37	mutes	functions inside objects? i guess?
2013-02-01 17:52:26	ditoa	the was I understood things were methods are just chunks of code that you can call e.g. writeline() but a function was a member of a class
2013-02-01 17:53:26	ditoa	both basically do the same thing how one is a member of a class (either private or public) but the other is not. so C has methods but C++ has functions. if that makes sense?

2013-02-01 18:02:38	ditoa	I don't know why but I love the look and feel of C++
2013-02-01 18:02:48	ditoa	it just seems to make sense to me compared to other languages for some reason
2013-02-01 18:03:48	ditoa	I know hardly anything about it but reading thru others code on github feels very natural in C++ compared to Python which I find a little frustrating for some reason
2013-02-01 18:04:35	ditoa	I guess it is because I still remember some C from a decade ago and I loved the structure of C
2013-02-01 18:06:23	ditoa	I came from writing vbscript's to grab event logs and monitor basic parts of the OS and while vbscript did the job it always felt messy or ugly compared to C. that was actually the reason I switched to learning C but when I moved jobs there was no need for any coding at all so I left it all behind me. I wish I had carried on as a hobby though

2013-02-02 01:28:51	tangentstorm	it's really annoying
2013-02-02 01:29:01	bwaxxlo	Sorry, my bad
2013-02-02 01:29:03	tangentstorm	np. because of the command line.
2013-02-02 01:29:34	bwaxxlo	I ask this because we don't initialize so in, let's say, javascript
2013-02-02 01:29:42	tangentstorm	on the command line you can say    java WhateverClass  abc 123 -rgb"red green blue"

2013-02-02 01:32:12	bwaxxlo	I tend to learn by breaking things down which is why I don't get the reason we always include main string [] args
2013-02-02 01:32:21	tangentstorm	dunno. try it.
2013-02-02 01:32:24	under2x	haha yeah try it
2013-02-02 01:32:41	bwaxxlo	compiler throws errors
2013-02-02 01:33:19	tangentstorm	my guess is when you go to run it, it will either not let you run it because it can't find  public static void main(String[] args) ... or it'll try to run   void main() and just ignore the command line.
2013-02-02 01:33:38	tangentstorm	compiler throwing errors could mean you broke something else.
2013-02-02 01:33:58	 *	tangentstorm approves of breaking things as a way to learn, as long as you're clear about what you broke. :)
2013-02-02 01:34:22	Malazin	alright:  Here's my problem, I have a function that needs to periodically call a certain, and while it isn't doing that, it should execute a different set of functions
2013-02-02 01:35:14	bwaxxlo	@Malazin: you should use a condition
2013-02-02 01:35:31	Malazin	currently I have it working, with an array of function pointers.  It loops up to the number of functions in the array, alternating function pointer, then periodic function.  Once it runs out of function pointers, it switches to just executing the periodic
2013-02-02 01:35:46	Malazin	the problem is that function pointers don't play nice, and I can't get my compiler to inline them
2013-02-02 01:36:19	Malazin	what do you mean condition?
2013-02-02 01:36:41	tangentstorm	function pointers don't play nice?
2013-02-02 01:36:41	Malazin	I should also state, that this is a common pattern, and this entire thing itself is a function
2013-02-02 01:36:54	Malazin	they work, but I have to actually call them, my compiler won't inline them
2013-02-02 01:37:09	Malazin	and I have roughly 48 instruction ticks between periodic calls
2013-02-02 01:37:10	Malazin	D=
2013-02-02 01:37:26	tangentstorm	Malazin: i have a virtual machine that works this way. How would the compiler know to inline them?
2013-02-02 01:37:27	bwaxxlo	how about creating different functions?
2013-02-02 01:37:41	tangentstorm	is the array static?
2013-02-02 01:37:44	Malazin	yes
2013-02-02 01:37:47	tangentstorm	not static, sorry.
2013-02-02 01:38:00	Malazin	the array is static and constant
2013-02-02 01:38:13	tangentstorm	so the functions in the array you're looping through are never going to change?
2013-02-02 01:38:17	Malazin	well, maybe I didn't declare it properly
2013-02-02 01:38:18	Malazin	I think it is
2013-02-02 01:38:21	Malazin	yes that is correct
2013-02-02 01:38:29	tangentstorm	then why do you need an array at all?
2013-02-02 01:38:36	Malazin	because this is a common pattern
2013-02-02 01:38:39	Malazin	and it would clean the code greatly
2013-02-02 01:38:44	tangentstorm	so is a case statement, which is what you want. :)
2013-02-02 01:39:16	Malazin	that's what I originally had
2013-02-02 01:39:19	tangentstorm	the array of functions makes perfect sense if the the array is going to change.
2013-02-02 01:39:22	Malazin	it's just very large.
2013-02-02 01:39:43	tangentstorm	there's nothing wrong with also using it for what you're doing but as you said the compiler won't inline it.
2013-02-02 01:39:58	Malazin	yeah, I think Clang simply doesn't have the optimization implemented yet
2013-02-02 01:40:11	Malazin	GCC does, but I'm not compiling for x86
2013-02-02 01:41:04	tangentstorm	hmm.. you're right... i guess it could be optimized if the compiler knows the array can't change... maybe gcc is just smart enough to take the constant array and turn it into a case statement...
2013-02-02 01:41:28	Malazin	apparently GCC just convinces itself that nothing can change the function pointers
2013-02-02 01:42:01	under2x	code?
2013-02-02 01:43:00	Malazin	let me strip it of any IP and I'll post it
2013-02-02 01:43:29	under2x	why do you care if it's inlined or not?
2013-02-02 01:44:50	under2x	yeah that appears to be a gcc optimization
2013-02-02 01:45:09	Malazin	I'm writing this for an MCU that is clocked at ~6 MHz
2013-02-02 01:46:24	under2x	ahh so perforamance ?
2013-02-02 01:46:38	Malazin	yeah
2013-02-02 01:47:01	under2x	yeah well clang has a way to go before it will have all the optimizations of gcc
2013-02-02 01:47:05	tangentstorm	Malazin: do you need to change the order in which the functions execute, or pause in between them?
2013-02-02 01:47:41	tangentstorm	because if not, then you don't even need the case statement... just one long function.
2013-02-02 01:48:11	Malazin	that's how it currently executes
2013-02-02 01:48:26	Malazin	it's just a very common pattern that I'm trying to make easier to work with

2013-02-02 01:52:50	Malazin	the MCU I'm coding for is proprietary, and I made the LLVM backend myself
2013-02-02 01:53:04	tangentstorm	ah yeah.. you're basically rolling your own multi-tasking here
2013-02-02 01:53:41	Malazin	can gcc output llvm byte-code?
2013-02-02 01:53:51	Malazin	I never even thought to try
2013-02-02 01:53:56	tangentstorm	Malazin: well if it were me, and i were using c++, i think maybe i'd put the function names in a text file, read that text file, and generate this code.
2013-02-02 01:54:11	Malazin	yeah I think that's what I might do actually
2013-02-02 01:54:11	tangentstorm	generate the giant case statement.
2013-02-02 01:54:12	Malazin	C-Preprocessor style

2013-02-02 01:55:38	under2x	well from what I've read clang supposedly can do this function pointer inline optimization
2013-02-02 01:56:01	Malazin	interesting.  Maybe I'm missing something?
2013-02-02 01:56:12	under2x	are your functions in the same lib?
2013-02-02 01:57:03	Malazin	they're in separate object files, so no?
2013-02-02 01:57:21	Malazin	I run an internalization pass after I link though
2013-02-02 01:58:24	under2x	seperate object files should be fine, it just can't inline if they are in another library
2013-02-02 01:58:51	Malazin	gotcha, yeah, there are no libraries for this bad boy
2013-02-02 01:59:54	under2x	are you doing llvm link time optimization?
2013-02-02 02:00:41	Malazin	yup!
2013-02-02 02:01:01	Malazin	I optimize at every step

2013-02-02 11:37:50	Moopington	Hey guys, I've got a quick question. Let's say I'm using python, and want to include this (http://urlgrabber.baseurl.org/) in my code. How would I go about including that? Do I have to install it on my system? Or can I just unpack it and put it in some "Dependencies" folder in my project?
2013-02-02 11:37:50	tamper	Moopington's shortened url is http://bit.ly/14GyoSZ
2013-02-02 11:40:01	Moopington	Reading up on it some more, should I just use urllib2? (Apparently it's included w/ python?) But honestly stuff like this has always confused me, and I should probably learn how to do this anyways..

2013-02-02 12:15:42	billbillerson	Hello all
2013-02-02 12:15:51	Amadiro	virtualghost, so what exactly is the issue?
2013-02-02 12:16:04	virtualghost	what is the standard output stream?
2013-02-02 12:16:20	Amadiro	virtualghost, on which operating system are you?
2013-02-02 12:16:20	tangentstorm	Moopington: but in this case i'm not sure they've set up a package. so... python will look for files in the place it's installed, and also check a list of directories specified in an environment variable called $PYTHONPATH
2013-02-02 12:16:42	virtualghost	windows 7
2013-02-02 12:16:45	virtualghost	x64
2013-02-02 12:16:51	tangentstorm	virtualghost: you know when you say cout << "hello world" ?
2013-02-02 12:17:00	Amadiro	virtualghost, okay. On windows, the "standard output stream" is usually invisible, but every program still has it attached to it.
2013-02-02 12:17:11	billbillerson	Hi folks, I'm trying to port a small python project to web site, looking for someone to point me in the right direction
2013-02-02 12:17:11	Moopington	Ok, I've already figured it out using urllib, but thanks for explaining it to me. :D
2013-02-02 12:17:22	Amadiro	virtualghost, if you print something to the standard output, and you have started the program from the cmd or powershell, that's where it will print the output
2013-02-02 12:17:44	Amadiro	virtualghost, if you use something like visual studio, eclipse or code::blocks, it's also possible that you have a small console at the bottom that displays what your program prints to stdout
2013-02-02 12:17:50	tangentstorm	virtualghost: it's just the console, or a pipe if you're redirecting output... it's wherever text goes when you print it :)
2013-02-02 12:17:51	virtualghost	i use codeblocks
2013-02-02 12:18:00	virtualghost	when i build and run a project it opens the cmd including hello world
2013-02-02 12:18:10	virtualghost	ok thanks
2013-02-02 12:18:11	Amadiro	virtualghost, a stream is basically like a stream of characters that you typically either write to or read from.

2013-02-02 12:18:42	Amadiro	virtualghost, okay, so then the cmd basically acts as your "standard output stream".

2013-02-02 12:19:34	virtualghost	if i type something other than hello world next to cout
2013-02-02 12:19:39	virtualghost	it will still print hello world
2013-02-02 12:19:50	Amadiro	virtualghost, then you forgot to recompile the program
2013-02-02 12:20:10	virtualghost	how do i do that in codeblocks?
2013-02-02 12:20:11	Amadiro	remember that you need to compile ("convert") your program from its C++ form into machine language before your computer can understand it
2013-02-02 12:20:31	Amadiro	don't know, there should be a "compile" or "build" button somewhere, I presume
2013-02-02 12:21:20	virtualghost	done,thanks :)
2013-02-02 12:21:21	virtualghost	the problem is that
2013-02-02 12:21:50	virtualghost	i am frustrated,because i cannot afford a tutoring and my friends from other classes with better teachers get further than me
2013-02-02 12:22:10	virtualghost	i have wanted to become a programmer since grade 5 ( 10 years old )
2013-02-02 12:22:41	Amadiro	virtualghost, in that case, you should probably not start with C++
2013-02-02 12:22:51	Amadiro	C++ is definitely one of the hardest language to start learning programming with
2013-02-02 12:23:10	Amadiro	instead, perhaps try an easier language such as python
2013-02-02 12:23:11	virtualghost	i know python and javascript..
2013-02-02 12:23:12	virtualghost	and i want to move to something more difficult
2013-02-02 12:23:20	virtualghost	unity uses C++ from what i've seen
2013-02-02 12:23:23	Amadiro	virtualghost, in that case, move to C first.
2013-02-02 12:23:40	Amadiro	C provides you challenge enough, and once you know C, the step to C++ is not as big anymore
2013-02-02 12:23:50	virtualghost	i have a C# book somewhere around here
2013-02-02 12:23:51	Amadiro	and there are a ton of cool things you can do in C that you can't do in most other languages

2013-02-02 12:24:04	virtualghost	ah
2013-02-02 12:24:28	virtualghost	can you recommend a good C book?
2013-02-02 12:24:31	Amadiro	C++ came after C (C is a very old language)
2013-02-02 12:24:36	virtualghost	i know..
2013-02-02 12:24:40	Amadiro	so C++ builds to a very large degree on the basic concepts C already gives you
2013-02-02 12:25:01	Amadiro	virtualghost, "The C programming language" by K&R is by most considered to be the bible.
2013-02-02 12:25:51	virtualghost	is it good for beginners?
2013-02-02 12:26:03	Amadiro	if you already know python & javascript, I think you'll be fine with that book.
2013-02-02 12:26:21	virtualghost	i didn't learn python and javascript from books
2013-02-02 12:26:32	virtualghost	i find books hard..
2013-02-02 12:26:38	Amadiro	virtualghost, by the way, unity may be written in C++, but to use it, you have to use C#, javascript or so.
2013-02-02 12:26:43	virtualghost	even if i have read a ton of them ( not related to programming languages )

2013-02-02 12:28:04	Amadiro	virtualghost, yes, to avoid that, you need to do exercises.
2013-02-02 12:28:11	virtualghost	maybe this is because english is not my first language
2013-02-02 12:28:21	virtualghost	ok
2013-02-02 12:28:21	Amadiro	just reading never suffices, you also need to try and apply the things you're learning
2013-02-02 12:28:28	Amadiro	then they'll stick
2013-02-02 12:28:51	Amadiro	K&R provides quite a few exercises, AFAIR, so make sure to do every single one of those
2013-02-02 12:28:53	virtualghost	thanks for your advices,I just want to get started with this,the more i think about it,the more frustrated i get
2013-02-02 12:29:04	virtualghost	is the second edition good?
2013-02-02 12:29:11	virtualghost	of K&R C

2013-02-02 12:29:59	virtualghost	ok reading it right now
2013-02-02 12:30:13	Amadiro	virtualghost, the second edition talks about ANSI C (C89)
2013-02-02 12:30:26	Amadiro	virtualghost, the newest version is C11, personally I prefer C99.
2013-02-02 12:30:41	Amadiro	the newest version of the C language, that is
2013-02-02 12:30:58	Amadiro	but don't worry about that, the difference between, say, C89 and C99 or C11 are not very big, just a few minor details you can learn later

2013-02-02 12:33:27	Amadiro	ask away, and I'll answer if I can
2013-02-02 12:33:41	phillyjapples	they basically parse a text file for data
2013-02-02 12:33:42	phillyjapples	and then dispaly the data
2013-02-02 12:33:55	phillyjapples	I want to put this on a website so a user can upload a text file
2013-02-02 12:34:11	phillyjapples	have all of it parsed and then view the data/stats
2013-02-02 12:34:14	virtualghost	by the way,when you first started C,was it hard or easy for you?
2013-02-02 12:34:44	phillyjapples	I basically just need to pointed in the right direction, as far as using python for web dev
2013-02-02 12:34:47	Amadiro	virtualghost, easy, but when I started with C, I already knew 4-5 other languages.
2013-02-02 12:35:01	virtualghost	damn..
2013-02-02 12:35:02	Amadiro	phillyjapples, there are different ways to go about it, you can use a framework such as web.py or use CGI, etc
2013-02-02 12:35:24	phillyjapples	well i need something pretty efficient, the code does take a bit of computation time
2013-02-02 12:35:41	Amadiro	phillyjapples, if the code takes a lot of computation time, the efficiency of the web-part won't matter
2013-02-02 12:35:51	phillyjapples	ok thats good to know
2013-02-02 12:36:04	Amadiro	phillyjapples, check out first what webserver you want to use and what it supports
2013-02-02 12:36:11	Amadiro	for instance lighttpd supports fcgi
2013-02-02 12:36:26	phillyjapples	sorry, whats fcgi?
2013-02-02 12:36:34	Amadiro	fastcgi
2013-02-02 12:37:18	phillyjapples	well can you recommend one that would handle traffic decently and port easily for someone thats not amazing at python?
2013-02-02 12:37:34	phillyjapples	I know its not going to be easy
2013-02-02 12:38:01	Amadiro	phillyjapples, personally I use python with lighttpd and fcgi.
2013-02-02 12:38:11	phillyjapples	ok awesome, I'll do some reading in that direction
2013-02-02 12:38:31	Amadiro	there are some fastcgi libraries for python available such as libfcgi
2013-02-02 12:38:34	phillyjapples	can python functions be directly used in these sorts of frameworks?
2013-02-02 12:38:42	Amadiro	I just generated the fcgi myself, but that's probably not very advisable

2013-02-02 12:39:11	phillyjapples	I've basically been working on the back end by just constructing a bunch of functions and hoping they'd be usable when I got to the front end
2013-02-02 12:39:24	Amadiro	phillyjapples, a traditional cgi web-app basically works so that 1) user requests page from server, 2) server starts your python script, 3) your python script prints out the web-page, 4) the server sents the stuff you've printed out to the user
2013-02-02 12:39:51	Amadiro	phillyjapples, where step 3) will typically have some additional meta-information you send from the script to the server using a protocol called CGI
2013-02-02 12:40:06	Amadiro	phillyjapples, so in the simplest case, a webapp would be just a python script that prints out a few things and then exits
2013-02-02 12:40:25	Amadiro	then you can import & call as many libraries as you want to
2013-02-02 12:40:43	phillyjapples	ok great, that may be a good place to start: take one of my simple functions and try to create a bare bones site that executes and prints
2013-02-02 12:41:11	Amadiro	If you want user-interaction such as the user being able to input something into a form or such, it gets a good deal more complicated
2013-02-02 12:41:30	phillyjapples	yeah, well I am going to need a bunch of that stuff eventually
2013-02-02 12:41:41	phillyjapples	file uploading, user login etc.
2013-02-02 12:41:53	Amadiro	Then maybe you're better advised to look at a webframework
2013-02-02 12:42:09	Amadiro	it will do more stuff for you
2013-02-02 12:42:24	phillyjapples	can you recommend a few of those?
2013-02-02 12:42:34	Amadiro	not really, I don't really do a lot of webdev
2013-02-02 12:42:39	phillyjapples	fair enough
2013-02-02 12:42:46	phillyjapples	well thanks so much for your help!
2013-02-02 12:42:48	Amadiro	django is popular, web.py is what reddit is written in
2013-02-02 12:42:51	Amadiro	(AFAIR)
2013-02-02 12:43:07	phillyjapples	ahh yeah i've heard of django
2013-02-02 12:43:41	phillyjapples	thanks again, I'
2013-02-02 12:43:42	Amadiro	remember though that running a django app will require different things from your webserver

2013-02-02 12:44:04	Amadiro	I believe for django you need to have a shell
2013-02-02 12:44:11	Amadiro	I don't know about web.py
2013-02-02 12:44:12	tangentstorm	nah
2013-02-02 12:44:16	phillyjapples	alrighty
2013-02-02 12:44:41	phillyjapples	I believe the web server I have supports django
2013-02-02 12:44:41	tangentstorm	heruko is django-friendly, as is app-engine... others maybe too
2013-02-02 12:45:01	tangentstorm	google app engine i mean
2013-02-02 12:45:14	Amadiro	django might be somewhat overpowered for your use anyway
2013-02-02 12:45:24	phillyjapples	It's just overwhelming, the amount of frameworks and ways to build a web app
2013-02-02 12:45:31	Amadiro	but I'll leave that decision to you, I don't know that much about it
2013-02-02 12:45:51	phillyjapples	well idealy my project will be someone complicated when i finish it haha
2013-02-02 12:45:51	phillyjapples	somewhat*
2013-02-02 12:46:04	tangentstorm	phillyjapples: yeah, but you don't need to learn them all... :)
2013-02-02 12:46:21	phillyjapples	haha I appreciate that
2013-02-02 12:46:41	phillyjapples	django seems to be the go to for python folks
2013-02-02 12:46:51	phillyjapples	as far as I can tell from a quick glance
2013-02-02 12:46:59	tangentstorm	as the author of another web framework for python i can say django is not a bad choice.
2013-02-02 12:47:11	compile_	I'm trying to return -1 in my program but I get a value of 4294967295
2013-02-02 12:47:21	compile_	i can't figure out why
2013-02-02 12:47:21	phillyjapples	maybe if I told you more about what I'm trying to do
2013-02-02 12:47:21	Amadiro	compile_, return to the operating system?
2013-02-02 12:47:22	Amadiro	as exit-status?
2013-02-02 12:47:29	tangentstorm	( you wouldn't want my stuff at the moment... no docs or anything online :/ )
2013-02-02 12:47:41	compile_	back to main Amadiro
2013-02-02 12:47:41	Amadiro	compile_, to main or from main?
2013-02-02 12:47:53	Amadiro	compile_, show us the code
2013-02-02 12:48:01	compile_	from a function
2013-02-02 12:48:02	compile_	long analyze()
2013-02-02 12:48:07	compile_	give me a sec
2013-02-02 12:48:46	tangentstorm	phillyjapples: from what you wrote, a simple cgi script is probably fine... but as you grow it you'll eventually want more features. if django is too overwhelming, try flask. it's small.
2013-02-02 12:48:52	Amadiro	web.py seems also to focus more on being minimal
2013-02-02 12:49:01	tangentstorm	phillyjapples: all python web frameworks (except maybe bad ones?) support a protocol called WSGI
2013-02-02 12:49:16	tangentstorm	WSGI lets them all work together anyway, so you really can't make  bad choice.
2013-02-02 12:49:34	tangentstorm	well you can make a bad choice but you won't be locked into it :)
2013-02-02 12:49:52	phillyjapples	tangentstorm, I built this python utility that parses an event log from TF2, it builds a data library and displays graphs and tables of stats.  I need the webapp to allow the user to upload a .txt file and then view the stats.  Eventally I want the app to store stats for different players and create a ranking system.  It will also eventually need a steam login to recoginze users.

2013-02-02 12:50:27	-->	HelloComputer15 (~Warrick@174-24-207-61.tukw.qwest.net) has joined #learnprogramming
2013-02-02 12:50:42	Moopington	Hey, when did we change Hamper's name?
2013-02-02 12:51:11	Moopington	I just noticed the T. XD
2013-02-02 12:52:01	tangentstorm	phillyjapples: i personally like google app engine, which lets you use any wsgi framework, but by default uses a very simple one that borrows the most important bits from django. app engine is probably free for what you're doing, until you start scaling to thousands of users
2013-02-02 12:52:41	compile_	any idea Amadiro?
2013-02-02 12:53:04	Amadiro	compile_, my guess would be that you return rv without ever setting it
2013-02-02 12:53:21	compile_	it does set.
2013-02-02 12:53:29	tangentstorm	4294967295 = -1
2013-02-02 12:53:53	compile_	?
2013-02-02 12:54:00	Amadiro	oh, yeah, you're just printing it out wrong
2013-02-02 12:54:01	tangentstorm	2 ** 32 -1
2013-02-02 12:54:11	tangentstorm	unsigned integer
2013-02-02 12:54:29	compile_	well if i run my function with a different main
2013-02-02 12:54:30	phillyjapples	god i love this stuff, 4294967295 = -1 is the best thing i've read all day
2013-02-02 12:54:30	compile_	i have 2 issues.
2013-02-02 12:54:51	compile_	rv doesn't = 1.
2013-02-02 12:54:51	phillyjapples	thanks so much tangentstorm and amadiro, have a great weekend
2013-02-02 12:54:52	Amadiro	phillyjapples, likewise
2013-02-02 12:54:54	tangentstorm	gl, phillyjapples :)
2013-02-02 12:55:03	compile_	and signal[] doesn't store anything.
2013-02-02 12:55:21	compile_	But if i print out signal ....it has stored something.
2013-02-02 12:55:22	compile_	i'm so lost with this.
2013-02-02 12:56:11	Amadiro	compile_, your code is fairly messy, I don't really have time to pluck it apart right now... but my general advise would be to decide on which C standard to use, and then set your compiler to the strictest setting possible with all warnings enabled (for instance for gcc something like "-std=c99 -pedantic -pedantic-errors -Wall -Wextra -O3", that'll tell you a lot about your code
2013-02-02 12:56:13	compile_	i'm just printing it because I keep failing the 1st test (it uses a different main).
2013-02-02 12:56:44	virtualghost	hey
2013-02-02 12:56:51	virtualghost	C is much better for me
2013-02-02 12:56:51	compile_	Amadiro: I can't change my schools compiler lol
2013-02-02 12:56:54	virtualghost	thanks for recommending
2013-02-02 12:56:57	compile_	if i could i'd update it.
2013-02-02 12:57:11	virtualghost	by the way what does the /n in hello world code mean?
2013-02-02 12:57:21	compile_	new line
2013-02-02 12:58:21	virtualghost	what does new line mean? sorry if this is a stupid question,but english is not my first language
2013-02-02 12:58:41	compile_	Like this.
2013-02-02 12:58:46	compile_	Hello\nWorld
2013-02-02 12:58:51	compile_	is
2013-02-02 12:58:51	compile_	Hello
2013-02-02 12:58:52	compile_	World
2013-02-02 12:59:10	compile_	instead of it being all on 1 line.
2013-02-02 12:59:30	@intothev01d	phillyjapples, I don't think anyone mentioned Flask yet, but that is a minimal easy to use web framework for Python as well
2013-02-02 12:59:31	virtualghost	ahh thanks
2013-02-02 12:59:54	compile_	np
2013-02-02 13:00:24	compile_	sigh this issue is griefing me.
2013-02-02 13:01:24	Amadiro	compile_, you should be able to chose the command line options you're using
2013-02-02 13:01:41	compile_	they disabled it.
2013-02-02 13:01:47	Amadiro	how
2013-02-02 13:01:52	compile_	I've tried before
2013-02-02 13:01:55	compile_	No idea
2013-02-02 13:02:01	Amadiro	which compiler is it
2013-02-02 13:02:21	compile_	gcc if not mistaken
2013-02-02 13:02:30	compile_	and i don't think its an updated version.
2013-02-02 13:02:34	Amadiro	just call gcc from the command-line, then you'll be able to pass it whatever options you want
2013-02-02 13:03:21	Moopington	So, this is kind of a weird question. This code works fine, but I was wondering if there's a better way to do this. All it does is download a file and extract it, but I've left a couple variables open for changing. Some of the code feels a bit.. clunky though. For example, line 21. If you guys have any suggestions, that would be great. http://pastebin.com/EXhJRYM2
2013-02-02 13:03:48	compile_	Amadiro i cant bud, I have have to simply use gcc filename.c
2013-02-02 13:03:57	Moopington	(Ps, sorry for the censoring :P )
2013-02-02 13:04:01	virtualghost	is it normal if my C code with hello world works fine without the /n ?
2013-02-02 13:04:06	Amadiro	compile_, why is that
2013-02-02 13:04:22	compile_	cuz my prof is anal.
2013-02-02 13:04:31	compile_	and wants it done his way
2013-02-02 13:04:31	Amadiro	compile_, your prof doesn't come into the picture
2013-02-02 13:04:44	Amadiro	compile_, just run with the options I gave you, and gcc will tell you more about what's wrong with your program
2013-02-02 13:04:48	compile_	what do you mean virtualghost?
2013-02-02 13:05:01	Amadiro	then you can fix those problems and compile the final version with just "gcc"
2013-02-02 13:05:03	compile_	ok i'll try on my *nix machine give me a few.
2013-02-02 13:05:11	Amadiro	virtualghost, it's \n, and yes, it won't stop working if you omit it -- it'll just look different
2013-02-02 13:05:24	Moopington	virtualghost: All it does is start a new line.
2013-02-02 13:05:51	compile_	Amadiro: with quotes or without?
2013-02-02 13:06:01	Amadiro	compile_, without
2013-02-02 13:06:15	Amadiro	compile_, but c99 might not be the standard you're supposed to learn -- probably ansi C
2013-02-02 13:06:38	compile_	yup
2013-02-02 13:06:43	compile_	i think it is Ansi C
2013-02-02 13:06:51	compile_	we aren't using malloc or anything.
2013-02-02 13:06:54	Amadiro	so try something like "gcc -ansi -pedantic -pedantic-errors -Wall -Wextra -O3 yourprogram.c"
2013-02-02 13:07:01	Amadiro	malloc exists in all versions of C
2013-02-02 13:07:02	compile_	funny thing is this is a OOP class lol
2013-02-02 13:08:01	compile_	yes i know, i'm just saying my school taught the basics of C.
2013-02-02 13:08:27	compile_	Ok so, all i have is warnings for unused variables.
2013-02-02 13:08:52	Amadiro	unused variables are almost always a mistake, so start by fixing that :)
2013-02-02 13:09:11	tangentstorm	I love how when you compile perl you see -Larry -Wall on half the lines of the make output... :)
2013-02-02 13:09:21	compile_	lol
2013-02-02 13:09:51	compile_	hmm
2013-02-02 13:09:58	compile_	can i run that command in Exclipse on windblows?
2013-02-02 13:10:11	compile_	Eclipse*
2013-02-02 13:10:11	compile_	nvm
2013-02-02 13:11:24	compile_	ok nvm, i have 0 errors 0 warnings.
2013-02-02 13:15:25	virtualghost	is there a compiler mistake if i get the /n in cmd?
2013-02-02 13:15:25	virtualghost	i mean it appears
2013-02-02 13:15:31	virtualghost	in the output ( cmd )
2013-02-02 13:15:45	compile_	paste the line of code virtualghost
2013-02-02 13:15:47	Amadiro	virtualghost, it's \n, not /n

2013-02-02 13:16:41	virtualghost	oh ok
2013-02-02 13:18:01	virtualghost	it tells me to try \c instead of \n , \c appears as c,what does it do?
2013-02-02 13:18:41	Amadiro	what tells you to use \c?
2013-02-02 13:19:10	virtualghost	exercise 1-2 Experiemnt to find out what happens when printf's argument string contains \c where c is some character not listed above
2013-02-02 13:19:31	Amadiro	it doesn't tell you to use \c instead of \n, it tells you to try both to see the difference
2013-02-02 13:19:55	Amadiro	the point being that \letter doesn't do anything unless the letter is in the table they listed

2013-02-02 15:35:53	Amadiro	chance, it's "piqued", btw
2013-02-02 15:36:07	tangentstorm	i know someone wrote a raytracer that worked entirely at compile time in d.
2013-02-02 15:36:40	Amadiro	tangentstorm, C, C++ and Haskell all have turing-complete type-systems/preprocessors, so you can do that kind of thing
2013-02-02 15:36:53	Amadiro	but it's obviously just a curiosity-thing with no usefulness to it

2013-02-02 15:41:10	Amadiro	no, haskells type-system is turing-complete
2013-02-02 15:41:21	Amadiro	you can implement a brainfuck interpreter in haskells type system in GHC

2013-02-02 15:42:34	Amadiro	it's also possible with Cs preprocessor, although extremely difficult and inefficient

2013-02-02 16:00:52	@chance	brb
2013-02-02 16:00:57	Amadiro	Nero_, you start by creating one node, and set its forwards and backwards pointer to NULL, then you save a reference to that node
2013-02-02 16:01:15	Amadiro	then to append something, you set that nodes "next" pointer to the newly created node, and the newly created nodes prev pointer to your root node
2013-02-02 16:01:34	Amadiro	(and the first nodes "prev" pointer is still NULL and the newly created nodes "next" pointer is still NULL)
2013-02-02 16:01:49	Amadiro	so that way you can build your linked list
2013-02-02 16:02:05	Amadiro	it usually pays off to keep a pointer to the first and last node around
2013-02-02 16:02:44	Nero_	ok
2013-02-02 16:03:04	Nero_	i got the one node with the pointers set to NULL

2013-02-02 16:07:44	tangentstorm	I don't ever set my pointers to null in my version.
2013-02-02 16:08:14	tangentstorm	instead i use an initial node called the clasp that starts with its prev and next pointers pointing to itself.
2013-02-02 16:08:22	tangentstorm	so it's always a ring.
2013-02-02 16:09:04	tangentstorm	the clasp just acts like a nullobject.
2013-02-02 16:12:04	Nero_	ok
2013-02-02 16:13:45	Nero_	i'll think about what Amadiro said and see if i can write some code and then show you guys it for some pointers(pun intended) on how to improve or fix it

2013-02-05 20:21:17	Electric_Sheep	Somehow I don't think that it would be in the scope of his specific problem, but that would be a good introduction to heuristics for global optimization.
2013-02-05 20:21:22	zebbiz	Why avoid Dev-C++?
2013-02-05 20:21:42	Electric_Sheep	But given the relatively small search space of solutions, he could just brute force it.

2013-02-07 20:38:45	Electric_Sheep	Well, strictly speaking you don't...
2013-02-07 20:39:18	Electric_Sheep	You should just statically allocate a pool of nodes.
2013-02-07 20:39:24	Electric_Sheep	But that limits runtime flexibility.

2013-02-07 20:41:52	Flexfit	I have to use linked list to multiply integers up to 10k digits
2013-02-07 20:43:33	Flexfit	I think dynamically allocated memory would work better

2013-02-07 20:45:04	Flexfit	now the professor wants it done with linked lists
2013-02-07 20:45:16	Electric_Sheep	I mean, if you really want to go nuts you could implement your own version of malloc()
2013-02-07 20:45:24	Electric_Sheep	That allocates and re-uses nodes
2013-02-07 20:48:53	Flexfit	how long would that take?
2013-02-07 20:55:13	Electric_Sheep	How much time do you have?
2013-02-07 20:55:53	Electric_Sheep	Note that that would be overkill and I don't recommend actually doing it for your assignment.

2013-02-12 16:17:07	tangentstorm	what?
2013-02-12 16:17:28	tangentstorm	oh i'm racing google
2013-02-12 16:17:36	tangentstorm	yes, fpc supports ios as a backend.
2013-02-12 16:17:48	carefish	suitable for games?
2013-02-12 16:17:53	tangentstorm	i thought you were complaining that every time you pressed enter it searched for something in google. :)
2013-02-12 16:18:07	carefish	like, i can use the provided SDL and ios backend to create a game?
2013-02-12 16:18:17	tangentstorm	probably

2013-02-12 16:19:17	tangentstorm	i don't know if you can use sdl on ios. it probably has its own thing like coregraphics or whatever.
2013-02-12 16:19:35	tangentstorm	but whatever it has you can use it from fpc using obejctive free pascal.

2013-02-12 21:03:54	ario	 instance is an occurrence or a copy of an object.
2013-02-12 21:05:01	tangentstorm	hmm... i wouldn't use the word copy... that would be like saying you're a copy of a person... :)
2013-02-12 21:05:55	ario	so one instance of an employee object has a name "John"
2013-02-12 21:05:59	tangentstorm	but yes, static methods don't have instances attached. that's why you can't use the "this" keyword in them.

2013-02-12 21:38:04	ElectricSheep	n[] is only ever used when declaring a type.
2013-02-12 21:38:19	ziikutv	I need to initialize n to the string "Buddy'
2013-02-12 21:40:40	ElectricSheep	n is not typed as a string. n is typed as a character array of length 90.
2013-02-12 21:40:55	ElectricSheep	A string is a pointer to a character.
2013-02-12 21:41:20	ElectricSheep	Which is the first character in a sequence terminated by NULL.
2013-02-12 21:41:40	ziikutv	well how can i have characters b u d d y
2013-02-12 21:41:42	ziikutv	inside n?
2013-02-12 21:42:00	ziikutv	i knew that. 'b','u','d','d','y' is what i am thinking

2013-02-12 21:42:10	tangentstorm	n[0]='b' and so on.
2013-02-12 21:42:29	tangentstorm	then put a n[5]=0
2013-02-12 21:42:29	ElectricSheep	You can do that, but its still not a string.
2013-02-12 21:42:54	tangentstorm	isn't an array the same thing as a pointer?
2013-02-12 21:43:08	ElectricSheep	No, not really.
2013-02-12 21:43:26	ElectricSheep	If it were, you could just do c.r.p.n = "BUDDY"
2013-02-12 21:44:00	tangentstorm	i know conceptually they are different but the actual implementation is the same
2013-02-12 21:44:00	tangentstorm	in c
2013-02-12 21:44:22	ziikutv	wrong
2013-02-12 21:44:31	ziikutv	I was expected to use
2013-02-12 21:44:43	ziikutv	strcpy(c.r.p.n,"Buddy");
2013-02-12 21:45:20	ElectricSheep	strcpy() is not safe.
2013-02-12 21:45:20	tangentstorm	i think you can do this. you just need to use a typecast.
2013-02-12 21:45:38	tangentstorm	either version i mean.
2013-02-12 21:47:32	ElectricSheep	A better call might be strncpy(c.r.p.n,"Buddy",sizeof(c.r.p.n));
2013-02-12 21:48:30	ElectricSheep	That will prevent overflowing past the end of n
2013-02-12 21:48:44	ElectricSheep	But you also need to explicitly set the last element of n to NULL, as strncpy does not guarantee that.

2013-02-12 22:08:47	zebbiz	Yeah, on the /r/ it says that if it's homework, we sould try to help them find the solution, not simply giving it to them.
2013-02-12 22:09:21	taternuts	I should probably read that
2013-02-12 22:09:39	taternuts	although I came here for help last night
2013-02-12 22:10:12	taternuts	tangentstorm helped me out
2013-02-12 22:11:51	--	chance is now known as ecnahc515
2013-02-12 22:14:11	taternuts	don't see anything about homework on the /r/, is it on the faq or something?
2013-02-12 22:14:40	zebbiz	let me check
2013-02-12 22:15:01	zebbiz	question from another channel:
2013-02-12 22:15:12	zebbiz	Hi.  is there a good SIMPLE library that I can parse URL's with?  I am being given ftp://user:password@hostname/path/to/file.ext and I seem to be having some issues handling special cases where user or password may have a special character in it
2013-02-12 22:15:21	zebbiz	i know Boost and such help with this...but the problem is its just too much for my simple project, i also don't have control of the test environment where this will be tested
2013-02-12 22:15:31	zebbiz	Language is c++

2013-02-12 22:16:59	zebbiz	When the question is about homework or otherwise school related, try to guide the poster to a solution instead of providing one directly.

2013-02-12 22:48:21	zebbiz	mutes: you have no return
2013-02-12 22:49:03	mutes	you mean after the loop zebbiz?
2013-02-12 22:49:21	zebbiz	At all
2013-02-12 22:49:33	mutes	That shouldnt be a problem, should it?
2013-02-12 22:49:42	mutes	move doesnt need to return anything
2013-02-12 22:49:43	zebbiz	Every function/method that is not void need a return
2013-02-12 22:49:46	taternuts	if you're expecting something other than a blank
2013-02-12 22:50:12	zebbiz	then set move to void
2013-02-12 22:50:16	mutes	even if i have it return 0 i get a blank terminal
2013-02-12 22:50:25	mutes	AND move to void
2013-02-12 22:50:52	zebbiz	Yeah, that shouldn't solve it
2013-02-12 22:51:01	zebbiz	just pointing it out
2013-02-12 22:51:01	mutes	:|
2013-02-12 22:51:04	mutes	thanks
2013-02-12 22:51:54	@intothev01d	also you're never incrementing win
2013-02-12 22:52:10	mutes	I know
2013-02-12 22:52:11	@intothev01d	or changing it's value away from 0
2013-02-12 22:52:12	zebbiz	cout << "got here"; doesn't give you anything either?
2013-02-12 22:52:29	@intothev01d	oh duh
2013-02-12 22:52:34	@intothev01d	you have a ; after your while condition
2013-02-12 22:52:43	mutes	win was originally a bool that would offset when I figured out an algorithm for determining it
2013-02-12 22:52:53	mutes	but i thought it might be the problem so i changed it
2013-02-12 22:53:02	mutes	no, the got heres dont appear
2013-02-12 22:53:05	@intothev01d	remove the ; after while (win == 0)
2013-02-12 22:53:07	zebbiz	intothev01d: aah
2013-02-12 22:54:21	mutes	brilliant  -__-
2013-02-12 22:54:31	@intothev01d	thats a legal statement too
2013-02-12 22:54:51	mutes	?
2013-02-12 22:55:02	@intothev01d	just that C++ sees that as legal and all so it compiles and then acts all crazy
2013-02-12 22:55:07	mutes	an empty while?
2013-02-12 22:55:22	mutes	weird
2013-02-12 22:55:32	tangentstorm	";" is the statement being looped over
2013-02-12 22:55:42	@intothev01d	it adds the { } block for you
2013-02-12 22:55:42	tangentstorm	good catch
2013-02-12 22:55:59	@intothev01d	behind the scence basically you have an empty block of code after your while loop
2013-02-12 22:56:09	@intothev01d	thanks
2013-02-12 22:56:10	zebbiz	but "got here" should still be printet, right?
2013-02-12 22:56:22	@intothev01d	apparently no
2013-02-12 22:56:22	@intothev01d	which is what is strange
2013-02-12 22:56:23	mutes	yeah, i thought so
2013-02-12 22:56:23	@intothev01d	to me
2013-02-12 22:56:52	zebbiz	mutes: does it work if you remove ;?
2013-02-12 22:56:53	mutes	oh yes :)
2013-02-12 22:56:59	zebbiz	huh'
2013-02-12 22:57:07	zebbiz	weird
2013-02-12 22:57:22	@intothev01d	you would think it would get hung after output, not before considering the statement happens later
2013-02-12 22:58:07	zebbiz	maybe it runs all code before printing it?
2013-02-12 22:58:13	<--	megha (~fire@unaffiliated/security) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 0.4.0)
2013-02-12 22:58:32	zebbiz	and since it's a infinite loop, it can't run the code
2013-02-12 22:58:35	tangentstorm	also the = is an assignment... should never be used in an "if"
2013-02-12 22:59:09	@intothev01d	could be something like that, not sure
2013-02-12 22:59:12	tangentstorm	also there's never a newline emitted.
2013-02-12 22:59:18	mutes	changed those right after pasting, yeah
2013-02-12 22:59:21	@intothev01d	ah thats it
2013-02-12 22:59:34	tangentstorm	i think without the newline you'll never get the output unless you flush it
2013-02-12 22:59:42	mutes	?
2013-02-12 22:59:59	mutes	oh he's right
2013-02-12 23:00:02	mutes	not that i know why
2013-02-12 23:00:05	zebbiz	what?
2013-02-12 23:00:12	tangentstorm	something about unix
2013-02-12 23:00:21	mutes	got here\n works
2013-02-12 23:00:21	zebbiz	could you explain tangentstorm?
2013-02-12 23:00:30	@intothev01d	yea if you use endl; it will flush the buffer and at least print
2013-02-12 23:00:41	tangentstorm	zebbiz: unix is line-oriented
2013-02-12 23:01:05	tangentstorm	so you need to output lines
2013-02-12 23:01:34	tangentstorm	otherwise they're buffered
2013-02-12 23:01:42	@intothev01d	won't work with just \n though, guessing related to the buffer thing
2013-02-12 23:01:58	@intothev01d	aha
2013-02-12 23:02:02	tangentstorm	mjd wrote a good article about it called "suffering from buffering"... (perl-oriented, but good)
2013-02-12 23:02:35	mutes	works with \n
2013-02-12 23:02:40	tangentstorm	http://perl.plover.com/FAQs/Buffering.html
2013-02-12 23:02:40	tamper	tangentstorm's url: http://bit.ly/Xzn57X
2013-02-12 23:03:12	zebbiz	tangentstorm: thanks, I'll read that
2013-02-12 23:03:17	tangentstorm	mjd is a really good writer. he wrote "higher order perl"
2013-02-12 23:03:23	tangentstorm	(big awesome book)
2013-02-12 23:03:35	zebbiz	But I can't see how that would cause any problems here?
2013-02-12 23:04:02	tangentstorm	he's not getting any output , evenwith his cout << "aoeuaeou" because there's no newline emitted
2013-02-12 23:04:15	tangentstorm	so the text he emits is just stuck in the stdout buffer and never flushed
2013-02-12 23:04:32	@intothev01d	right
2013-02-12 23:04:34	tangentstorm	flush is an operation that outputs the stuff in the buffer without needing the newline
2013-02-12 23:04:42	@intothev01d	which even \n won't cover
2013-02-12 23:04:42	@intothev01d	endl forces the flush
2013-02-12 23:05:01	tangentstorm	endl then :)
2013-02-12 23:05:03	@intothev01d	thats the difference in the usage of the two, from what i understand
2013-02-12 23:05:12	@intothev01d	\n or enld
2013-02-12 23:05:12	@intothev01d	endl*
2013-02-12 23:05:57	tangentstorm	maybe the iostream does its own buffering separate from the os buffering...
2013-02-12 23:05:59	@intothev01d	funny we're talking about this b/c the professor for 1010 is constantly saying oh yea doesn't matter \n or endl are the same use whatever… i'm like… no they arent
2013-02-12 23:07:22	tangentstorm	mutes: so did you get it working?
2013-02-12 23:07:32	zebbiz	So I can't use cout<<"lkasdh"; some code; cout<<"hello world"<<endl; and expect it to print "Hello world"?
2013-02-12 23:07:53	mutes	yeah tangentstorm, got a lame printboard function up too
2013-02-12 23:08:00	@intothev01d	zebbiz, yea you can
2013-02-12 23:08:00	tangentstorm	:)
2013-02-12 23:08:08	mutes	just have to figure out how it can learn win conditions
2013-02-12 23:08:22	mutes	#hackerrank
2013-02-12 23:08:32	@intothev01d	but not when it gets hung like that, b/c again its stuck in the buffer until flushed, the while loop prevents that by hanging yet endl seemingly forces it
2013-02-12 23:08:39	@intothev01d	just a weird case
2013-02-12 23:08:40	tangentstorm	whats hackerrank?
2013-02-12 23:09:03	mutes	im not really sure, im just doing the puzzles on it instead of going by my book
2013-02-12 23:09:10	mutes	sort of trying to immersion learn
2013-02-12 23:09:12	zebbiz	but when demandin input with cin>>row; he must use
2013-02-12 23:09:17	tangentstorm	oh
2013-02-12 23:09:17	zebbiz	return*
2013-02-12 23:09:22	tangentstorm	https://www.hackerrank.com/
2013-02-12 23:09:23	tamper	tangentstorm's url: http://bit.ly/Xznojf
2013-02-12 23:09:41	zebbiz	Doesn't that flush?
2013-02-12 23:11:00	tangentstorm	i doubt return  flushes anything
2013-02-12 23:11:04	@intothev01d	zebbiz, his code had while (win == 0); which is a blank while loop, never hits anything after that to call the function with cin
2013-02-12 23:11:32	tangentstorm	magic stuff doesn't normally just happen in system-level languages
2013-02-12 23:11:38	@intothev01d	mutes wins interesting problem of the day (from me anyway)
2013-02-12 23:11:52	mutes	-.-
2013-02-12 23:12:22	zebbiz	I think I understand.
2013-02-12 23:12:42	zebbiz	Another question on the same topic.
2013-02-12 23:12:55	@intothev01d	this is what makes programming fun for me. seeing stuff i see all the time just barely different enough to cause these weird situations where you gain a deeper understanding of what happens
2013-02-12 23:13:13	zebbiz	If I have this code: int num; cin>>num;
2013-02-12 23:13:39	zebbiz	and the input is: 12 e 12
2013-02-12 23:14:18	zebbiz	num==12; and " e 12" would still be in buffer?
2013-02-12 23:14:54	tangentstorm	yes
2013-02-12 23:15:01	@intothev01d	c++ will probably shit itself with a failure im guessing but probably. the read pointer will stop at the failure
2013-02-12 23:15:32	@intothev01d	this is kind of how code exploits work right? injecting code through problems that arise from stuff like this
2013-02-12 23:15:44	tangentstorm	actually i think " " would be consumed. i don't know. easy to test.
2013-02-12 23:15:56	zebbiz	if the input would be "e 12". How would it react then?
2013-02-12 23:15:58	@intothev01d	i was/am curious about how causing things to fail would allow you to execute other code
2013-02-12 23:15:59	tangentstorm	ask c++, don't ask us :)
2013-02-12 23:16:09	@intothev01d	it fails on e
2013-02-12 23:16:21	@intothev01d	if you never clear the fail bit and ignore the e character
2013-02-12 23:16:37	@intothev01d	so it will just keep failing unless you move the read pointer along
2013-02-12 23:17:12	zebbiz	So it doesn't iterate through the input to the first type it is looking for?
2013-02-12 23:17:24	tangentstorm	no
2013-02-12 23:17:24	@intothev01d	no, that would be skipping data
2013-02-12 23:17:32	zebbiz	IIRC Ada does that.
2013-02-12 23:17:33	@intothev01d	you have to explicitly tell it what to do
2013-02-12 23:18:32	tangentstorm	there are probably libraries for any language that will do that, it's just not what c++ does by default :)
2013-02-12 23:22:48	zebbiz	Hmmm, I do have a faint memory that it was a library that our professor had written that we could use.
2013-02-12 23:25:34	@intothev01d	thats a great article tangentstorm, really explains a lot of problems that arise with io
2013-02-12 23:25:42	@intothev01d	in terms of the buffer
2013-02-12 23:28:19	tangentstorm	yeah, his whole site rocks

2013-02-13 20:06:29	Flexfit	Anyone good with linked lists?
2013-02-13 20:06:51	intothev01d_m	still working on the C linked list from yesterday Flexfit?
2013-02-13 20:07:09	Flexfit	I have to multiply the linked lists now
2013-02-13 20:07:16	Flexfit	I did this previously with arrays
2013-02-13 20:07:31	Phenax	What is the result? Another linked list?
2013-02-13 20:07:37	Flexfit	yep
2013-02-13 20:07:37	Phenax	Just printing the values?
2013-02-13 20:07:44	Flexfit	stored in another linked list
2013-02-13 20:07:52	Phenax	Are the linked lists guaranteed to be the same size?
2013-02-13 20:08:06	Flexfit	so least significant digit is first
2013-02-13 20:08:07	Flexfit	no
2013-02-13 20:08:11	Flexfit	they can be different sizes
2013-02-13 20:08:15	Flexfit	1-10k digits
2013-02-13 20:08:46	Phenax	If one of the linked list is smaller, then the elements with no corresponding elements, do they remain the same?
2013-02-13 20:09:00	Phenax	i.e, {1, 2, 3, 4} * {1, 2, 3} = 1, 4, 9, 4?
2013-02-13 20:09:12	Phenax	i.e, {1, 2, 3, 4} * {1, 2, 3} = {1, 4, 9, 4} rather
2013-02-13 20:09:23	Flexfit	I am using linked lists to represent large integers
2013-02-13 20:09:27	Phenax	oh
2013-02-13 20:09:32	Flexfit	each node is a single digit
2013-02-13 20:09:53	Flexfit	I did this with arrays
2013-02-13 20:10:01	Flexfit	but i'm thinking this is more difficult
2013-02-13 20:10:26	Flexfit	since I can't simply just access the nth node very easily
2013-02-13 20:10:38	compile_	just a quick question if i see this in source if (number == -1L)
2013-02-13 20:10:54	compile_	what does the -1L do? more specifically the L?
2013-02-13 20:10:58	Phenax	Flexfit: It's not O(1), but it's not exactly hard either.
2013-02-13 20:11:07	Phenax	compile_: It's a long constant instead of an integer constant
2013-02-13 20:11:36	compile_	ah ok
2013-02-13 20:11:44	compile_	that makes sense now.
2013-02-13 20:11:46	Flexfit	this is the code I used with arrays
2013-02-13 20:11:47	Phenax	compile_: It's probably because the 'number' variable is a long
2013-02-13 20:11:47	Flexfit	http://pastebin.com/ea1dPqGC
2013-02-13 20:11:57	compile_	ya it is returning num
2013-02-13 20:11:58	Phenax	compile_: And he doesn't want to cast in the comparison (depending on the language, semantics, whatever)
2013-02-13 20:12:01	compile_	which is a long
2013-02-13 20:12:08	compile_	its C
2013-02-13 20:12:18	compile_	but thanks Phenax
2013-02-13 20:12:33	Phenax	Flexfit: So basically you want to make a function that returns the nth node of your linked list, then
2013-02-13 20:12:44	Phenax	It's not O(1) like an array, it's O(n), but it's not hard.
2013-02-13 20:13:03	Phenax	So you pass to the function the head of your linked list
2013-02-13 20:13:18	Phenax	and then do linkedlist = linkedlist->next, n times
2013-02-13 20:13:27	Phenax	or at least that's the basic train of my thought
2013-02-13 20:14:17	Phenax	And with that function made, it should be very similar to your array code.
2013-02-13 20:15:08	Flexfit	i see
2013-02-13 20:15:42	Flexfit	it would return the node itself or the value inside of the node?
2013-02-13 20:16:23	Phenax	Returning the node itself, as it will be easier to modify the value of the node that way
2013-02-13 20:16:38	Phenax	Or you can return a reference to the value - so long as it's modifiable
2013-02-13 20:16:53	Phenax	i.e., return &value;
2013-02-13 20:19:15	Phenax	So you'd do something like node *x = getNode(i); and then reference the value by using x->value
2013-02-13 20:20:42	Phenax	In this case, because indexing is so heavy, I'd say arrays are a better approach, but obviously this is just your homework so you gotta do it ^^
2013-02-13 20:22:34	Flexfit	this work?
2013-02-13 20:22:36	Flexfit	http://pastebin.com/p40AFGd9
2013-02-13 20:24:15	Phenax	That looks good - i don't think there's a need for the temporary value though, you can just modify the parameter "node" directly and return it, since it's just passed by value and won't modify the head or anything
2013-02-13 20:24:41	Phenax	(of course, a temp never hurt)
2013-02-13 20:24:50	Flexfit	so just node= node->next; ?
2013-02-13 20:25:25	Phenax	yes, that should work - temps are just a common idiom in linked list-related code due to the fact that much of the time you want to preserve the head for later use in the case, in this specific case, it's not required
2013-02-13 20:27:32	Phenax	Could you re-paste your array code real quick?
2013-02-13 20:29:25	Flexfit	http://pastebin.com/6irUZDaQ
2013-02-13 20:29:25	Phenax	Flexfit: pq->digits = calloc((p->size + q->size), sizeof(int));
2013-02-13 20:29:46	Phenax	Heh, nevermind
2013-02-13 20:30:55	Phenax	Flexfit: So in this code, are all elements in the resultant array initialized to 0?
2013-02-13 20:31:02	Flexfit	yes
2013-02-13 20:31:08	Phenax	calloc should do that
2013-02-13 20:31:08	Phenax	I suppose
2013-02-13 20:31:09	Flexfit	since i'm adding it
2013-02-13 20:31:37	Phenax	So then, in your linked list, you'll want to initialize all values to 0
2013-02-13 20:31:56	Flexfit	I don't know how long the resultant linked list is off the bat

2013-02-13 20:35:17	Phenax	well, assuming you want to use the same algorithm, you'll need to create a linked list of size (p->size + q->size) and initialize all of the values to 0
2013-02-13 20:35:49	Phenax	I'm not sure if your assignment wants to use the same algorithm or adjust it to create the linked list dynamically as you're running the algorithm
2013-02-13 20:37:30	Flexfit	for (i=0; i < (lengthP + lengthQ); i ++)
2013-02-13 20:37:32	Flexfit	        pq = Add_Front(pq,0);
2013-02-13 20:37:39	Flexfit	something along those lines then?
2013-02-13 20:38:26	Phenax	Yea, that looks about right, not sure why you switched from p->size and q->size to lengthP and lengthQ
2013-02-13 20:38:45	Flexfit	size was part of the old assignment
2013-02-13 20:38:49	Flexfit	old struct
2013-02-13 20:39:25	Flexfit	the new struct doesn't contain the size, I had to write a function to do that.
2013-02-13 20:40:06	Phenax	They probably intend for you to adjust the algorithm, then

2013-02-13 20:41:35	Flexfit	I was given the function prototype.

2013-02-13 20:49:56	Phenax	Flexfit: How are you determining the size of the resultant array for your array version?
2013-02-13 20:49:58	Phenax	Flexfit: It seems to me like you're not really
2013-02-13 20:50:12	Flexfit	I had section of the code
2013-02-13 20:50:23	Flexfit	line 46
2013-02-13 20:50:26	Flexfit	http://pastebin.com/6irUZDaQ
2013-02-13 20:51:33	Phenax	Alright so line 41 says that if the last element - 1 of the oversized array is not 0, then pq->size=i+j
2013-02-13 20:51:47	Phenax	else it is equal to i+j-1
2013-02-13 20:51:56	Flexfit	yep
2013-02-13 20:52:12	Phenax	But unless I'm missing something this isn't ran in a loop or anything
2013-02-13 20:52:42	Phenax	Thus if you are adding a 5 digit number and a 5 digit number the only possible outcomes are a 10 digit number or a 9 digit number
2013-02-13 20:53:17	Flexfit	Yes
2013-02-13 20:53:42	Phenax	100 + 100 = 200 which is a 3 digit number
2013-02-13 20:54:04	Flexfit	That code seemed to work with all the test cases I threw at it
2013-02-13 20:54:06	Phenax	the result of adding a 3 digit number and a 3 digit number is either a 3 digit number and a 4 digit number
2013-02-13 20:54:39	Phenax	When you do 100+100 using your add method, what is the result of pq->size?
2013-02-13 20:54:44	Phenax	obviously it should be 3.
2013-02-13 20:55:42	Phenax	In yours, it will likely be 2+2 = 4
2013-02-13 20:56:02	Phenax	I could be wrong, and feel free to ignore me if you think I'm an idiot ;)
2013-02-13 20:56:04	Flexfit	It's set up for multiplication
2013-02-13 20:56:16	Flexfit	for adding, I would probably modify it
2013-02-13 20:56:36	Phenax	oh poo
2013-02-13 20:56:37	Phenax	So the linked list is adding
2013-02-13 20:56:45	Phenax	and the array is multiplying?
2013-02-13 20:56:49	Flexfit	yep
2013-02-13 20:57:06	Phenax	Hah, I misunderstood
2013-02-13 20:57:30	Phenax	OK, for link list adding, you will just need to find the sizes of the two linked lists once
2013-02-13 20:58:01	Phenax	It's easy to make a function to find the size of a linked list if you already haven't
2013-02-13 20:58:06	Flexfit	I already did that
2013-02-13 20:58:19	Flexfit	while (head != NULL)
2013-02-13 20:58:19	Phenax	Then you need to make a function to loop over the largest linked list
2013-02-13 20:59:02	Phenax	Your resultant linked list is initially empty
2013-02-13 21:00:06	Phenax	For the first iteration, it should add the 1s place on your 2 input linked lists, and add it in the back of your resultant linked list
2013-02-13 21:00:18	Phenax	it needs to record the carry-out however
2013-02-13 21:00:36	Phenax	and then for the 2nd iteration, it should add the 2s place, and the carry-out, and then insert it in the back of your resultant linked list
2013-02-13 21:00:36	Phenax	and so on
2013-02-13 21:01:06	Phenax	err

2013-02-13 21:01:20	Flexfit	am almost done
2013-02-13 21:01:26	Flexfit	I will post the code in a sec
2013-02-13 21:01:36	Flexfit	thanks for the help Phenax.
2013-02-13 21:01:46	Phenax	Yeah my bad, I thought you were trying to do multiplication with the linked lists which is a tougher problem
2013-02-13 21:02:56	Flexfit	you mean like  a matrix?
2013-02-13 21:03:17	Phenax	I mean applying your previous algorithm directly to linked lists
2013-02-13 21:03:38	Phenax	Matrix multiplication and such are an even bigger problem, of course :)
2013-02-13 21:04:36	Phenax	Linked Lists are great in some scenarios, but for things such as matrix multiplication, they aren't great
2013-02-13 21:04:59	Phenax	Although in software engineering in general arrays are overused in some cases where data structures such as linked lists could be more efficient
2013-02-13 21:05:16	Flexfit	how would I get rid of leading 0s in the resultant array?
2013-02-13 21:05:35	Phenax	Wait - your output for this was an array?
2013-02-13 21:05:48	Phenax	Didn't know that either T_T
2013-02-13 21:06:06	Phenax	you can do the same thing as before only it's either the size of the larger one, or the size of the larger one + 1
2013-02-13 21:06:16	Flexfit	the resultant is an array
2013-02-13 21:06:17	Flexfit	no
2013-02-13 21:06:20	Flexfit	linked list
2013-02-13 21:06:21	Flexfit	sorry
2013-02-13 21:06:40	Phenax	Well, if you're just adding elements to the back, you shouldn't need such a calculation
2013-02-13 21:07:09	Phenax	But if you made a linked list of size whatever
2013-02-13 21:07:26	Phenax	for addition, the size should be  max(p->size, q->size)+1
2013-02-13 21:07:26	Flexfit	How does this look?

2013-02-13 21:08:12	Phenax	Flexfit: Does it return the right result barring the leading 0s?

2013-02-13 21:11:06	Phenax	OK - so this algorithm isn't going to work at all, because the way you modeled it was basically after what I initially said which was based on you multiplying
2013-02-13 21:11:08	Phenax	but you're adding

2013-02-13 21:11:46	Phenax	[20:56:58] <Phenax> So the linked list is adding
2013-02-13 21:11:46	Phenax	[20:57:03] <Phenax> and the array is multiplying?
2013-02-13 21:11:46	Phenax	[20:57:10] <Flexfit> yep

2013-02-13 21:12:06	Flexfit	they are both multiplying

2013-02-13 21:15:01	Phenax	does it really crash on that specific line of code?
2013-02-13 21:15:09	Phenax	Or does it crash on something in the multiply() function
2013-02-13 21:15:09	Phenax	if so
2013-02-13 21:15:14	Phenax	what line, specifically
2013-02-13 21:15:37	Flexfit	It was crashing on the for loop that sets the linked list to 0
2013-02-13 21:15:46	Flexfit	but after
2013-02-13 21:15:56	Flexfit	I changed it to BigInt* pq;

2013-02-13 21:19:31	Phenax	The reason your Add_Front takes a BigInt ** is because it modifies the head. To modify the head, you need a reference to the head, otherwise it will be passed as value and modifying it will only effect the local value

2013-02-13 21:27:10	Flexfit	lets see what's wrong
2013-02-13 21:27:29	Phenax	Flexfit: First of all, does findNthNode return what you expect it to?
2013-02-13 21:27:46	Flexfit	How would I check that?
2013-02-13 21:28:00	Phenax	Make a linked list like
2013-02-13 21:28:06	Phenax	{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
2013-02-13 21:28:06	Phenax	then try
2013-02-13 21:28:11	Phenax	findnthnode(ll, 0)
2013-02-13 21:28:16	Phenax	should be 5
2013-02-13 21:28:21	Phenax	findnthnode(ll, 1) should be 4
2013-02-13 21:28:21	Phenax	etc
2013-02-13 21:28:42	Phenax	alternatively, just match it with the same array index expression with an array with the same values
2013-02-13 21:29:26	Phenax	viro: So basically
2013-02-13 21:29:46	Phenax	viro: You put 1 and 2 on the stack. You hit the *, and you pop them off and put the result of the multiplication on the stack. So now we have 2 on the stack.
2013-02-13 21:30:45	Phenax	viro: Put 3 and 4 on the stack, our stack is now {2, 3, 4}. We hit the /. Take 3 and 4 off the stack, divide them, put .75 on the stack. {2, .75} is the stack. We hit the +. So we take 2 and .75 off the stack, add them, and now we have 2.75 on the stack, which is the answer
2013-02-13 21:30:47	Phenax	rightmost = top of stack
2013-02-13 21:31:06	Phenax	viro: If you need more help just ask
2013-02-13 21:32:38	Phenax	and by the way my linked list notation is horrible it should be more like 5->4->3->2->1 or whatever
2013-02-13 21:34:08	Flexfit	it's returning the right node
2013-02-13 21:35:36	Phenax	Flexfit: I think your problem may be that you need to keep a reference to your head.
2013-02-13 21:35:39	Phenax	When you do stuff like:
2013-02-13 21:35:46	Phenax	pq = findNthNode(pq, j+i);
2013-02-13 21:35:51	Phenax	that may be the 5th node.
2013-02-13 21:35:59	Phenax	Now your code calls findNthNode(pq, ...) later
2013-02-13 21:36:05	Phenax	and it's finding the nth node starting from the 5th node
2013-02-13 21:36:19	Flexfit	that might be the case
2013-02-13 21:36:26	Flexfit	should I do a temp then?
2013-02-13 21:36:44	Phenax	Yep, create a temp
2013-02-13 21:37:26	Phenax	Your findNthNode should always be called with the head of your linked list, in your case
2013-02-13 21:37:48	Phenax	But your program almost instantly overwrites all of your heads - lol
2013-02-13 21:43:59	Flexfit	if I'm doing a +=
2013-02-13 21:44:08	Flexfit	should I use the temp or the original?

2013-02-15 22:31:28	tangentstorm	basically, i asked the author if he would be interesting in mentoring somebody who wanted to contribute, and he was enthusiastic.
2013-02-15 22:31:56	mutes	i dont know if i know enough D:
2013-02-15 22:32:14	tangentstorm	yeah probably not. you should let that stop you and just give up.
2013-02-15 22:32:41	mutes	tangentstorm, one takes geometry before they take calc, no?

2013-02-15 22:33:25	tamper	mutes actually meant: "uh...go take calc."
2013-02-15 22:33:31	tangentstorm	i don't have a good answer to that.
2013-02-15 22:33:52	@intothev01d	you'll never learn anything trying to stay inside of a comfort zone
2013-02-15 22:34:02	tangentstorm	i have a tendency to just jump into whatever and figure it out as i go. that's worked well for me, but i know not everyone is like that.
2013-02-15 22:34:25	tangentstorm	but my standard advice to new developers is: make tetris. :)
2013-02-15 22:34:50	@intothev01d	thats pretty much how i go about it as well. a lot of times it seems overwhelming and all but you kind of learn to deal with that and it makes sense if you're willing to try
2013-02-15 22:35:18	hg341	what the actual fuck? its 18 bucks
2013-02-15 22:35:38	hg341	this is why people pirate stuff
2013-02-15 22:35:55	mutes	sorry, i didnt mean to whine
2013-02-15 22:36:01	mutes	also i think ledger is in python
2013-02-15 22:36:13	tangentstorm	mutes: it's got python bindings
2013-02-15 22:36:14	mutes	thats how clueless i am about this thing
2013-02-15 22:36:27	@intothev01d	hg341, because they don't want to pay for things?
2013-02-15 22:36:35	mutes	ah sr
2013-02-15 22:36:37	mutes	c
2013-02-15 22:36:44	hg341	because the prices are insane
2013-02-15 22:36:56	@intothev01d	$18 for a book is insane?
2013-02-15 22:37:14	hg341	im not going to pay 18$ for an ebook version of a 23 year old book
2013-02-15 22:37:31	@intothev01d	then you're not the target market
2013-02-15 22:37:43	hg341	18 for a real book is just fine
2013-02-15 22:37:58	@intothev01d	hard cover may cost you more like 30
2013-02-15 22:38:10	hg341	last hard cover i got was 22
2013-02-15 22:38:13	@intothev01d	also it has to take up space on a shelf

2013-02-15 22:39:14	hg341	its a physical thing and it wont be taken away from you when the store folds in
2013-02-15 22:39:16	@intothev01d	so there are benefits to ebooks, searchable, more portable, reable on different devices, you can preserve your copy (backups) so it has value, and is actually cheaper than the physical versions
2013-02-15 22:39:20	hg341	like an ebook
2013-02-15 22:39:26	@intothev01d	you can crack the drm
2013-02-15 22:39:31	@intothev01d	if thats what you're worried about
2013-02-15 22:39:47	hg341	nope just dont want to pay 18 bucks for an ebook
2013-02-15 22:39:52	@intothev01d	im just saying, you're paying for content mostly, not format

2013-02-15 22:40:34	@intothev01d	thats what bugs me the most about people nowadays with digital content
2013-02-15 22:40:35	hg341	a regular book has real over head so it is reasonable to assume it will cost more
2013-02-15 22:41:18	@intothev01d	so it's cool to pay for printing and distribution costs? you don't think they have to serve up the books somewhere as well? editing and publishing isn't the same?
2013-02-15 22:41:18	hg341	a ebook just has server maintenance/bandwidth overhead which is likely payed for by ads
2013-02-15 22:41:52	tangentstorm	what ads? :)

2013-02-16 14:25:16	Amadiro	"sharp" is not exactly vocabulary
2013-02-16 14:25:26	Amadiro	alcohol tastes sharp

2013-02-16 14:26:56	mutes	close enough
2013-02-16 14:26:57	timg	guess it's not the common usage

2013-02-16 17:12:01	Krenium	Depends on what you want to do with it.
2013-02-16 17:12:18	ProfElm	Automate stuff.

2013-02-16 17:12:46	Krenium	Perl is good at automating things, yes.
2013-02-16 17:12:47	ProfElm	E.g. automate testing some how.

2013-02-16 17:13:02	Krenium	But if, for example, you're learning a language so you can get a job coding in it, you won't find many people looking for perl programmers.

2013-02-16 17:19:09	ProfElm	I currently work as a web developer and feel that I am underpaid. However, I went to school for Mathematics/Actuarial Science. I don't know how I can better my current situation.
2013-02-16 17:19:38	Krenium	Everyone is underpaid these days. Welcome to globalization
2013-02-16 17:19:43	Amadiro	perl is not useless; it's still used a lot.

2013-02-16 17:22:23	ProfElm	I was using of Perl as a scripting language.
2013-02-16 17:22:28	ziikutv	I would suggest you use Python instead.
2013-02-16 17:23:13	Krenium	Probably the only reason you'd use perl over python is if you really hate the "one way to do things" python philosophy.
2013-02-16 17:23:25	Krenium	Perl doesn't push dogma on you.
2013-02-16 17:23:28	ziikutv	If you feel you are underpaid, I suggest you learn Python. Reason: You can use it as an alternative to Perl.. plus you can spend a tiny amount of more time and learn Django. Django is a web framework built on top of Python. Its amazing actually.
2013-02-16 17:23:58	Amadiro	perl is getting older fairly fast nowadays, but there'll still be enough jobs to make a career of it 10 years from now
2013-02-16 17:24:23	Amadiro	so if you like it or already know it, that's certainly not a worthless thing on the job-market

2013-02-16 17:25:58	ziikutv	Yeah, sorry I still say Python will offer you more jobs. Django is fairly new and if you learn Python and a bit of Django (goto djangoproject.com or www.gettingstartedwithdjango.com) you will get a job in web development field.

2013-02-16 17:26:56	Amadiro	Django isn't very new, really
2013-02-16 17:26:56	Amadiro	it first came out 2005

2013-02-16 17:27:13	Amadiro	but that's a good thing -- from a job market attractiveness perspective it's usually not the greatest idea to always jump on new technologies
2013-02-16 17:27:26	Amadiro	unless that's your thing and you're aiming to "ride the wave"
2013-02-16 17:27:28	ziikutv	people consider Rails to be "new" yet its a year older
2013-02-16 17:28:13	ziikutv	Honestly, its probably not wise to get our opinion. The fuck do we know. Ask your boss to see what you can do to increase your pay!
2013-02-16 17:28:33	ziikutv	Communication is key.
2013-02-16 17:28:41	Krenium	For every company that uses the hot new thing to launch a successful product, I bet there are 10 others that use it just because it's the hot new thing.
2013-02-16 17:29:14	ziikutv	I agree
2013-02-16 17:29:23	ziikutv	but this nw thing is "hot" for a reason.
2013-02-16 17:29:41	Krenium	Eh..
2013-02-16 17:29:55	Krenium	It's more like fashion than just good tech.
2013-02-16 17:30:00	Amadiro	Krenium, well, that's probably also true for older technologies, but trying to always go with "the hot new thing" brings a whole set of additional problems, and it's not really a well-regarded practice in the industry
2013-02-16 17:30:08	ziikutv	You can argue an say it the otherway, some people do not like to use the Hot new thing because they are stuck up bitches
2013-02-16 17:30:22	ProfElm	I think that I'm going to try Python.
2013-02-16 17:30:25	ProfElm	I have some experience with it.
2013-02-16 17:30:33	ProfElm	But I think that I can leverage it.
2013-02-16 17:30:40	ProfElm	My first program was in python.
2013-02-16 17:30:56	ProfElm	Actually, I lied. It was in Java.
2013-02-16 17:31:08	Krenium	Mine was in BASIC, then Pascal.
2013-02-16 17:31:16	ProfElm	But my first open source program was in Python.
2013-02-16 17:31:18	Krenium	Pascal is a really nice language
2013-02-16 17:31:48	ziikutv	ProfElm: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ got me A+ without attending a single class in my university. Very good concrete resource (free too) and then if you wish to use Python for webdevelopment,  djangoproject.com then gettingstartedwithdjango.com

2013-02-16 17:33:19	ziikutv	I am sure you will have more opportunities with Python on your side, which is why I was persistent. Sorry if I came off rude.

2013-02-16 17:34:15	Amadiro	ProfElm, Pygame is nice (it's a wrapper for SDL), but its very slow, so only simple low-res 2D games are possible (unless you use it in conjunction with OpenGL)
2013-02-16 17:34:25	mutes	why dont you use sdl ProfElm

2013-02-16 17:36:46	Amadiro	AI has generally fallen out of favour with the industry, there are only a handful of companies anymore that care about AI research

2013-02-16 17:41:20	Krenium	And let's be honest here: most of the programming jobs available out there don't require advanced math or even in-depth knowledge of algorithms/data structures..
2013-02-16 17:41:49	Krenium	A lot of it is just simple business logic and UI stuff.
2013-02-16 17:41:50	ziikutv	Agree w/ Amandiro.

2013-02-16 17:42:44	Amadiro	at least to some degree, the curve is a little weird

2013-02-16 17:45:00	mutes	indeed
2013-02-16 17:45:45	Amadiro	mutes, personally I think int *x should be preferred; otherwise you might be led to believe that "int* a,b,c" declares three pointers, whereas only a is a pointer, b and c are ints.
2013-02-16 17:45:59	Amadiro	"int *a,b,c" makes that fairly clear

2013-02-16 19:10:54	@NoaHall	You'd be better off approaching local companies, sending them a CV and telling them why they should hire you. It helps a lot to have something you can show off - maybe build an impressive looking site to host your CV and then send them a link to that

2013-02-16 19:38:37	mutes	i guess im not
2013-02-16 19:38:50	@chance	its true
2013-02-16 19:38:56	mutes	ive been flitting around dynamic memory for a week now :P
2013-02-16 19:39:10	@chance	really, once you've gotten decent at programming, its not really out of reach to get a really nice job
2013-02-16 19:39:47	mutes	the problem i have is measuring that decenc
2013-02-16 19:39:47	mutes	y
2013-02-16 19:39:47	@chance	its really just about having work to show your skills, and having connections to people in those nice organizations/businesses
2013-02-16 19:39:56	@chance	well once youve been programming for about a year, its not too hard to do most things
2013-02-16 19:40:33	@chance	once you've gotten over the basics, learned your first language, done some data structures and basic algorithms, from there, learning new languages, and new types of things to do with languages isnt very hard
2013-02-16 19:40:47	@chance	you just get to a point where you can pick up stuff after a little bit of time using them
2013-02-16 20:08:13	biio	getting to the point were javadoc (or such) doesn't feel that hostile is quite awesome, I reached that point not to long ago

2013-02-16 21:25:50	@chance	TheChance: actually it didnt
2013-02-16 21:25:56	@chance	you defined the function without a return type
2013-02-16 21:26:13	@chance	you define it as "void showTitle();" at the top, but at the bottom it doesnt have a return type
2013-02-16 21:26:14	@chance	which should be void
2013-02-16 21:26:24	@chance	void bookType:: showTitle()
2013-02-16 21:26:33	@chance	also, you might change it from bookType to "Book"
2013-02-16 21:26:54	@chance	typically classes begin with a captial letter, and describe a type of object
2013-02-16 21:27:10	@chance	the word type is redundant
2013-02-16 21:37:13	TheChance	chance: I had intended to have it return a string, and have changed the definition to "string showTitle();". I didn't realize convention was to begin classes with a capital letter. Go go Gadget find-and-replace!
2013-02-16 21:38:27	TheChance	Oh, no, wait. I remember now. I did read in the text that convention is to capitalize, but the assignment is very clear about turning in "class bookType" with a UML diagram, and the professor is anal about one thing and one thing only: name everything EXACTLY as he specifies.

2013-02-16 22:00:55	TheChance	chance, mutes: I think it's an oversight. The next assignment is class TicTacToe.
2013-02-16 22:01:29	TheChance	Is there a good way to initialize a multidimensional array with default values inside a class?
2013-02-16 22:02:39	TheChance	"array = {whatever};" and "array = {{whatever}};" both generate compiler errors, and I can't find any literature on using std::fill() for a multidimensional array.
2013-02-16 22:03:19	mutes	er
2013-02-16 22:05:38	mutes	you mean array[whatever][whatever] = {{whatever},{whatever}},{{whatever},{whatever}};
2013-02-16 22:05:59	TheChance	yeah
2013-02-16 22:06:06	mutes	what error
2013-02-16 22:06:10	TheChance	although they all get the same default value anyway
2013-02-16 22:06:17	TheChance	so I'd rather just use {whatever}
2013-02-16 22:06:22	mutes	is this tic tac toe
2013-02-16 22:06:49	TheChance	yeah, I'm trying to initialize "char m_gameBoard[3][3] = {'-'};"
2013-02-16 22:07:03	mutes	right
2013-02-16 22:07:20	mutes	so you dont get Y - ^ - 2, et.al
2013-02-16 22:07:30	TheChance	Quite.
2013-02-16 22:07:30	mutes	i remember i did that and ignored it, lol
2013-02-16 22:07:37	mutes	on the same class problem
2013-02-16 22:07:56	TheChance	Well, it's a win-win with the default value, anyway, since an empty space is gonna be represented by '-'.
2013-02-16 22:08:13	mutes	how about space
2013-02-16 22:08:27	mutes	for when you print board
2013-02-16 22:08:43	TheChance	I thought about that, but then I have to throw a bunch of if statements into the output, which is formatted.
2013-02-16 22:10:15	TheChance	I'd rather just use a vector, for that matter, but I run into the same problem with initialization anyway.

2013-02-16 22:14:59	TheChance	Mine's academic, but I'm not in the class I'm working through. Our professor posts all the assignments on the department page and they rarely change substantially, so I'm doing all of next term's work ahead of time.

2013-02-17 00:54:15	TheChance	Just ask your question. Someone will eventually come along who's qualified to help you.
2013-02-17 00:56:09	Jaivan	well, i don't really have an specific question, i made a program, but it's just not working. Should i paste the project's download link here?
2013-02-17 00:56:24	TheChance	Good God. Okay. In C::B, there's a Compiler & Linker Settings menu, in which I can specify directories that should be searched when looking for #includes. How in the name of God do I do that in Netbeans?
2013-02-17 00:57:04	TheChance	Jaivan: Yeah, post your code to something like pastebin.com and shoot us a link, preferably with error messages, or else describe the errors you get.
2013-02-17 00:57:37	Jaivan	http://www21.zippyshare.com/v/89664174/file.html well there's no errors. it's just not working as expected.

2013-02-17 00:57:49	TheChance	In what way?
2013-02-17 00:58:36	Jaivan	it's supposed to use multithreading, but it takes it one thread at a time.
2013-02-17 00:58:37	TheChance	Ooh. Post it to pastebin. Folks don't take kindly to needing to download a file. Pastebin will just show us the source.
2013-02-17 00:58:37	Jaivan	oh ok

2013-02-17 01:16:32	swamper5	Hello im having some trouble in Java, I'm trying to make a program that stores information then makes a new txt file to store it. When you make the file it names itself according to the username the person inputs. But when you make the file the file is always named null.
2013-02-17 01:16:42	swamper5	https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4970419
2013-02-17 01:17:31	TheChance	Have you tried implementing a test print to make sure that rName is being assigned as it should?
2013-02-17 01:20:20	swamper5	yes when you open the file it displays the username
2013-02-17 01:26:59	TheChance	Alright, I really don't remember much from Java class (been since high school) but I'm wondering if the problem is in the implementation, can we see that too?
2013-02-17 01:27:13	TheChance	Like whatever file calls these functions.
2013-02-17 01:27:40	swamper5	heh can i just give you the whole code? I'm a complete beginner
2013-02-17 01:28:08	TheChance	Yeah, go ahead.
2013-02-17 01:28:17	swamper5	https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4970451
2013-02-17 01:29:32	swamper5	oh and this is the main class https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4970455
2013-02-17 01:29:37	TheChance	Aha, I was about to ask.
2013-02-17 01:29:52	TheChance	There it is.
2013-02-17 01:30:11	swamper5	what's the problem?
2013-02-17 01:30:18	TheChance	You need to call inputInfo(); before you call openFile();. Right now, you're calling openFile(); first, at a time when rName has not yet been assigned a value.
2013-02-17 01:30:57	swamper5	oh darn i didnt switch those after i switched the methods
2013-02-17 01:31:02	swamper5	thanks :)
2013-02-17 01:31:04	TheChance	This is a good reason to always give variables default values; if you declared "private String rName = "default";", you would get "default.txt" which is easier to spot.
2013-02-17 01:31:06	TheChance	My pleasure.
2013-02-17 01:31:59	TheChance	Notice to Airmen: Jaivan has a C# question above, which is now buried.
2013-02-17 01:33:05	swamper5	alright it works! Thank you very much
2013-02-17 01:33:54	TheChance	'S what we're here for, I rely on these guys a lot =P

2013-02-17 10:36:01	robmadeyou	Hi
2013-02-17 10:36:46	chandankumar	robmadeyou, i need an advice.
2013-02-17 10:37:24	robmadeyou	Go on
2013-02-17 10:37:24	chandankumar	i am in final year of b.tech in computer science and engineering.
2013-02-17 10:37:24	chandankumar	Only Three months are left for passing out.
2013-02-17 10:37:29	chandankumar	And i donot know any programming language
2013-02-17 10:37:37	chandankumar	 i have wasted my two years in translating open source software.
2013-02-17 10:38:10	chandankumar	there is no scope of translators in india.
2013-02-17 10:38:39	chandankumar	in this time i am in need of job.
2013-02-17 10:38:39	chandankumar	And i want to learn programming any how.
2013-02-17 10:38:54	chandankumar	i am confused at a point which programming language i will choose to get started?
2013-02-17 10:39:24	robmadeyou	Alright, well have you looked into any languages?
2013-02-17 10:39:24	robmadeyou	I mean there is a wide spectrum of languages out there
2013-02-17 10:40:07	robmadeyou	for me I tried HTML just to get into programming, I moved to python and now Java.
2013-02-17 10:40:07	chandankumar	robmadeyou, i need to ask which language i will choose through which i can to open source in these months so that i can get a job?
2013-02-17 10:41:39	chandankumar	robmadeyou, so i lock python.
2013-02-17 10:42:08	robmadeyou	I'd suggest doing Java, only because I found it almost the easiest; it's more than possible to learn the basics and more in 3 months; if you spend every day for an hour or so

2013-02-17 10:44:39	chandankumar	then i will surely do in these three months.
2013-02-17 10:45:01	robmadeyou	To start; there are a few tutorials of my favorite. To start Bucky from thenewboston has a very large collection of tutorials (100+ tutorials on just Java)
2013-02-17 10:45:46	robmadeyou	Youtube is a great resource for any tutorials, you just have to look for them

2013-02-17 10:56:17	Amadiro	except for some rare occassions, maybe
2013-02-17 10:56:52	robmadeyou	oh no, I'd agree but for someone who doesn't know any programming, I think it would be a lot more helpful to see it done and talked through
2013-02-17 10:58:51	robmadeyou	What I prefered to do is get the source code from the video, and then edit it, if I don't understand a bit then see what the video did
2013-02-17 10:59:35	Amadiro	perhaps

2013-02-17 21:07:10	TheChance	The parameters you have to pass to main when you do that include a pointer, and that's how we learn to write C++.
2013-02-17 21:11:29	mutes	i should take a class -__
2013-02-17 21:12:38	TheChance	I dunno. Full disclosure, once I discovered I could learn all this stuff on my own just by checking the assignments for the rest of the term and powering through them, I kinda stopped going to classes. I'm actually on academic probation because a little thing called "exams" slipped my mind once I did that.
2013-02-17 21:13:01	TheChance	Point being, you don't *need* to take a class if you're a strong learner and you insist on getting through this.
2013-02-17 21:14:28	TheChance	Program arguments aren't covered in any of the classes my school offers. I had to do that on my own (and am happy to share the code, by the way). It's all about running with the little things. "Hey, it would be really cool if I didn't have to write all this test code every time. I can run command-line programs with -verbose flags, I should learn to do that. JENKINS! START THE GOOGLE!"

2013-02-17 21:27:55	shade34321	I'm workiing on my homework assignment for exceptions in C++. In Visual Studio and xcode my code compiles but via terminal my code does not. https://gist.github.com/shade34321/4974779 that is the list of files I'm using and the errors I"m getting, the txt file. Any suggestions on what I"m missing?
2013-02-17 21:29:14	ElectricSheep	how are you building in the terminal?
2013-02-17 21:29:17	ElectricSheep	makefile?
2013-02-17 21:29:22	TheChance	In addressing this question, could someone explain why Mac users get that "Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:" error so freaking often?
2013-02-17 21:29:39	TheChance	I can compile the same code from my Windows box and it doesn't happen.
2013-02-17 21:29:52	shade34321	ElectricSheep, g++ -o main.out main.cpp
2013-02-17 21:30:17	shade34321	TheChance, It works in xcode, like Visual studio but for OSX, just not the terminal in OSX or linux
2013-02-17 21:30:20	@chance	gcc -v
2013-02-17 21:30:27	ElectricSheep	shade: You need to include the sources (or generated object code) for Employee.cpp and ProductionWorker.cpp
2013-02-17 21:30:44	shade34321	ElectricSheep, ok, what does that mean?
2013-02-17 21:30:47	TheChance	shade34321: I got you, I just wonder what the hell that error means. I get it, too, in Xcode and Code::Blocks.
2013-02-17 21:30:54	shade34321	We just started using multiple files.
2013-02-17 21:31:01	shade34321	TheChance, oh ok:)
2013-02-17 21:31:11	ElectricSheep	g++ -o main.out main.cpp Employee.cpp ProductionWorker.cpp
2013-02-17 21:31:12	@chance	^
2013-02-17 21:31:14	shade34321	ElectricSheep, oh ok
2013-02-17 21:31:45	ElectricSheep	For small builds, just passing all source files to g++ in one statement is fine.
2013-02-17 21:31:47	ElectricSheep	But for larger builds, you will need a build system.
2013-02-17 21:31:48	ElectricSheep	Like make or cmake.
2013-02-17 21:31:48	shade34321	ElectricSheep, thank you!!!
2013-02-17 21:32:00	shade34321	ElectricSheep, I've been told that before
2013-02-17 21:32:26	TheChance	What would we do in- so that's what make is for. Epiphany. All these years I just sorta ran with it. "run ./make to proceed" "alrighty!"
2013-02-17 21:32:58	shade34321	it's a good thing my teacher uses OSX, terminal, and Windows to test our code but it's also a curse. Turned in an assignment that worked in xcode before but when he compiled it on the terminal it didn't run and then he couldn't break in with my xcode><
2013-02-17 21:33:08	shade34321	ElectricSheep, I appreciate the help!
2013-02-17 21:33:14	shade34321	Lets see if I can get the second project to buidl now
2013-02-17 21:33:43	TheChance	shade34321: I keep ALL my code in my Dropbox so that I can bounce up to my Windows box and make sure it runs.
2013-02-17 21:33:43	ElectricSheep	The reason why it works in XCode and Visual Studio is because IDEs will generally automatically add files as target dependencies.
2013-02-17 21:33:53	ElectricSheep	And it will handle all of the necessary flag to pass to the compiler upon building.
2013-02-17 21:33:54	shade34321	TheChance, same here
2013-02-17 21:34:01	TheChance	Good man.
2013-02-17 21:34:03	@chance	you could just
2013-02-17 21:34:05	@chance	use git
2013-02-17 21:34:11	@chance	which is real source control
2013-02-17 21:34:28	shade34321	ElectricSheep, well the other assignment it was because xcode was using c++11. Though he didn't give us a version to use he still didn't accept it
2013-02-17 21:34:28	shade34321	chance, working on that
2013-02-17 21:34:29	TheChance	chance: I'm learning git. Just switching to Dropbox was like waking up from a deep sleep.
2013-02-17 21:34:39	TheChance	I had been carting shit around on a USB key.
2013-02-17 21:34:59	shade34321	lol
2013-02-17 21:35:14	shade34321	alright both work...time to finish my my midterm project
2013-02-17 21:35:29	TheChance	shade34321: Are you required to use Xcode or can you use whatever IDE you want? I've found it to be horrifying as a beginner tool. Netbeans and Code::Blocks have been much smoother, as a newbie.
2013-02-17 21:35:59	@chance	as a newbie, you shouldnt be using an IDE!
2013-02-17 21:36:00	TheChance	Just don't uninstall Xcode or it'll take your compilers along with.
2013-02-17 21:36:05	@chance	you should know how the compile process works
2013-02-17 21:36:14	@chance	by experience
2013-02-17 21:36:15	@chance	and practice
2013-02-17 21:36:42	ElectricSheep	Well, you can always create an External Build System project in XCode.
2013-02-17 21:36:56	TheChance	chance: The CS department at Chemeketa started us out with Code::Blocks for the first term because it's portable and cross-platform and almost idiot-proof. He taught us how to use the debugger and logger, and in week 4 of term 2 we did our first manual compile.
2013-02-17 21:36:56	ElectricSheep	And build using gcc/gnu make.
2013-02-17 21:37:12	ElectricSheep	From within XCode.
2013-02-17 21:37:12	@chance	sounds relatively good.
2013-02-17 21:37:12	@chance	its just an important thing
2013-02-17 21:37:29	TheChance	I know, but I like my hand held.
2013-02-17 21:37:29	@chance	and knowing how to do it on your own is important :)
2013-02-17 21:37:29	@intothev01d	i keep all my projects in dropbox, keeps from having to upload/download changes when im working on the laptop.
2013-02-17 21:37:44	shade34321	TheChance, I can use whatever I want. I tend to switch up between vim, notepad++ to type code
2013-02-17 21:37:45	shade34321	and visual studio or xcode to help debug
2013-02-17 21:37:56	@chance	intothev01d: i backup stuff to dropbox for class work, thats it though
2013-02-17 21:37:58	TheChance	shade34321: Fair enough. If you feel compelled to use an IDE on OS X, though, I really can't recommend Not Xcode any more highly.
2013-02-17 21:38:23	@chance	thats because sometimes i need to change locations/use a lab computer at a moments notice, and having it always up to date is nice
2013-02-17 21:38:29	@intothev01d	yea exactly
2013-02-17 21:38:29	@chance	i wish dropbox had git integration
2013-02-17 21:38:48	TheChance	chance: Put a git client in your dropbox?
2013-02-17 21:38:51	@intothev01d	i think it has some sort of versioning (obviously not git though)
2013-02-17 21:39:02	TheChance	And then just run it from wherever you be.
2013-02-17 21:39:04	shade34321	TheChance, why? Xcode is awesome once you know how to use, had my teacher give a brief rundown on it
2013-02-17 21:39:22	shade34321	chance, why not just create a git repo on it?
2013-02-17 21:39:22	@chance	what i meant is i wish it interfaced with git more
2013-02-17 21:39:36	@chance	like, if you went into a git project, you could see git information
2013-02-17 21:39:38	shade34321	chance, oh ok. github:)
2013-02-17 21:39:41	@chance	relavant to the project
2013-02-17 21:40:07	@intothev01d	like it could read your git log would be cool
2013-02-17 21:40:07	TheChance	shade34321: Because the alternatives are substantially better-featured and easier to use. IMO, anyway. Code::Blocks takes a lot of heat for being kind of like My First IDE, but it really does the job. Get the Mountain Lion-stable version, though.
2013-02-17 21:40:08	@chance	yeah, i would like it if kept its micro changes for outside of commits
2013-02-17 21:40:21	@chance	but id like it if when i commit, it used that
2013-02-17 21:40:30	@chance	in its revision control
2013-02-17 21:40:52	shade34321	what would be cool
2013-02-17 21:40:52	TheChance	Suggestion for LearnProgramming project: Dropbox client with better git integration.
2013-02-17 21:41:00	TheChance	So meta.
2013-02-17 21:41:15	@chance	heh, that would be difficult considering dropbox isnt open source
2013-02-17 21:41:25	TheChance	Isn't it? There exist third-party clients, I guess I just assumed.

2013-02-17 21:43:44	TheChance	I obviously don't know what I'm talking about, but I feel like the existence of this API should render this theoretically possible: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core

2013-02-17 23:03:02	TheChance	Well isn't that the purpose of Catch?
2013-02-17 23:03:02	TheChance	Previous to this I've been using console output triggered by the -v flag.
2013-02-17 23:03:02	@chance	but if you think theres situations where you know an exception can come up, and you want to handle it, you should
2013-02-17 23:03:50	TheChance	Oh, I don't mean try...catch, I mean a TDD framework called Catch.hpp which makes error checking pretty much modular and hard to screw up.

2013-02-18 18:23:30	@intothev01d	TheChance, when you said tier do you just mean multiple choice options 1-5 or like 1 tier gives more options for a second tier of more options?
2013-02-18 18:23:56	TheChance	One tier gives more options for a second tier.
2013-02-18 18:24:24	TheChance	Right now I just have a function for the top level which calls separate functions for the lower levels until it's told to quit.
2013-02-18 18:24:54	TheChance	And the functions for the lower levels will loop until they're told to back up a level.
2013-02-18 18:25:07	TheChance	Well, until break;.

2013-02-18 19:05:51	TheChance	Halfhearted attempt at translating their forums, I guess.
2013-02-18 19:08:09	Phenax	I might be a little late/off here
2013-02-18 19:08:26	Phenax	but if you want to make decent menus and such in C++ you probably want to use NCurses library or somesuch
2013-02-18 19:08:54	Phenax	You can also use windows libraries but obviously they aren't portable
2013-02-18 19:09:41	Phenax	The problem with something like a nice, dynamic window in a console is that there is no standard way to do things like clear a console, or draw to the top of the console, or (in some scenarios) get the height/width of a console
2013-02-18 19:11:09	Phenax	So you need to either identify and target a certain platform/technology (Windows/cmd.exe) and use their solution (conio.h) or use a portable solution such as NCurses that handles most platform-specific things for you.
2013-02-18 19:12:18	Phenax	Actually, PDCurses seems like a better solution as there are well-maintained binaries for most platforms whereas NCurses has lackluster Windows support
2013-02-18 19:13:09	Phenax	You can also implement cool stuff like mouse support :)

2013-02-18 19:38:22	TheChance	Alright, then. Can I define functions prototyped in a header, using a .cpp file that doesn't bear the same name as the header?
2013-02-18 19:38:59	TheChance	I've got a header file containing a class, and I want to keep the definitions for the class in a separate file.
2013-02-18 19:39:16	TheChance	(Versus the function that utilize the class, which I'm also going to have to declare in the header)
2013-02-18 19:39:44	ElectricSheep	Yes. you can name your files whatever you want.
2013-02-18 19:39:51	TheChance	Awesome. Danke.
2013-02-18 19:39:54	@intothev01d	thats the point of headers and cpp files. you prototype everything in the header, you can then put the implementation in another file
2013-02-18 19:39:58	ElectricSheep	But for maintainability, its best to match headers.
2013-02-18 19:40:18	TheChance	Another file, or as many other files as I want?
2013-02-18 19:40:31	ElectricSheep	The critical thing is scope.
2013-02-18 19:40:39	ElectricSheep	The function prototype must be declared in the scope that it will be used
2013-02-18 19:40:48	ElectricSheep	Or the linker will not know how to lookup symbols.

2013-02-18 19:46:12	ElectricSheep	What is happening in that example is that the header declares a public-facing class which doesn't actually declare the full implementation.
2013-02-18 19:46:31	ElectricSheep	But instead has a single private member which is a pointer to a class where you will do the real work.
2013-02-18 19:46:41	ElectricSheep	That class will be fully declared and implemented in a .cpp file.
2013-02-18 19:46:59	ElectricSheep	You can distribute headers and object code while keeping the full implementation hidden.
2013-02-18 19:47:19	TheChance	I'm working with BankAccount.h, BankAccount.cpp, mainTester.cpp, bankAccountTester.cpp, and similarly named files for each of a couple classes derived from BankAccount. So if I want class definitions to be in their own file, I have to put them in BankAccount.cpp, and put the various functions that -utilize- said class in BankAccountTester.cpp, but since I can only turn in one .h file I have to prototype eve
2013-02-18 19:47:19	TheChance	rything in there.
2013-02-18 19:47:23	ElectricSheep	Without risking namespace collisions.

2013-02-18 19:50:29	@intothev01d	why would he limit you to 1 header file?
2013-02-18 19:50:54	@intothev01d	that doesn't make much sense
2013-02-18 19:51:28	ElectricSheep	Does it? Depending on how many students I have, I might want to make things easy for me
2013-02-18 19:51:34	ElectricSheep	By forcing them to turn in a single header file.
2013-02-18 19:51:41	ElectricSheep	Rather than potentially dozens.

2013-02-18 19:51:54	@intothev01d	how do you arive at dozens for something simple like that?
2013-02-18 19:52:07	@intothev01d	why not just 1 .h and 1 .cpp then
2013-02-18 19:52:14	@intothev01d	or just cram it all in 1 .cpp
2013-02-18 19:52:15	ElectricSheep	I could declare a separate header and source file for every single class.
2013-02-18 19:52:21	ElectricSheep	Plus a main.cpp
2013-02-18 19:52:36	@intothev01d	i counted about 2 classes for that problem. how did you get dozens?
2013-02-18 19:53:26	@intothev01d	that was i thought also the point of object oriented programming. thinking about classes, polymorphism, inheritance etc
2013-02-18 19:53:26	ElectricSheep	Depends on how crazy you want to get.
2013-02-18 19:53:53	ElectricSheep	You could have a bank object, a transaction object, a tender object, an account holder object, etc, etc
2013-02-18 19:54:01	@intothev01d	so you're saying they're just going to go hog wild and come up with about 10 other classes?
2013-02-18 19:54:09	ElectricSheep	You could have objects for any supporting data structures.
2013-02-18 19:54:12	@intothev01d	ok fine, what says they won't do that with .cpp then
2013-02-18 19:54:15	ElectricSheep	a list object, tree object, node objects.
2013-02-18 19:54:26	TheChance	Just finished the article. Awesome.
2013-02-18 19:54:44	TheChance	intothev01d: This is the week we're supposed to be learning about TDD.
2013-02-18 19:55:02	TheChance	So I think the theory is that he wants us to isolate the class we're writing from relevant tests and main() and its tests.
2013-02-18 19:55:36	TheChance	But he also doesn't want a particularly large number of files, because they each have to go through some plagiarism bot and Doxygen and, due to the nature of this assignment, he can't create an automated test program for this one.
2013-02-18 19:56:03	TheChance	So he has to compile and run and examine everybody's lap separately. Hence, one .h file per class, two .cpp files per header.

2013-02-18 19:56:18	@intothev01d	thats fine. i don't care why he has the requirements. but i can also say it wouldn't make much sense that way particularly. if he's lazy then cool
2013-02-18 19:57:34	TheChance	Yeah, I actually wrote into main's dox that I'd really rather give the classes their own dedicated headers.
2013-02-18 19:58:40	@intothev01d	everyone is so quick to defend the idea though as if that's the way things are usually done, which they aren't

2013-02-18 20:00:29	TheChance	Automate as much as possible, minimize the number of files you have to comb through, slowly work students toward a big project at the end of the year that's done right.
2013-02-18 20:00:50	@intothev01d	again i disagree but it doesn't much matter other than the fact you're now stuck trying to manipulate it to get it to work
2013-02-18 20:02:03	mutes	why couldnt you throw everything into one header anyway
2013-02-18 20:02:15	mutes	^ honest question

2013-02-18 20:07:24	TheChance	No, looking through one file is harder.

2013-02-18 20:07:41	mutes	yeah, thats what i meant
2013-02-18 20:08:14	@intothev01d	specifically the overwhelmed by thousands of lines of code? one
2013-02-18 20:08:39	TheChance	If every class has its own header and source file, called something like ThisClass.h/cpp and ThatClass.h/cpp, when you build a dependency that requires you to change ThisClass, you don't have to hunt through this long header that also contains ThatClass.
2013-02-18 20:08:54	TheChance	And TheOtherClass, and AnotherClass, and SomeOtherClass. Just looking for like 662.
2013-02-18 20:09:01	TheChance	A single character on 662.

2013-02-18 20:09:44	@intothev01d	its also about code reuse
2013-02-18 20:09:49	TheChance	Every function in every implementation file I'm writing for this class contains its own instance of a reusable variable called inputAmount.
2013-02-18 20:09:59	@intothev01d	say i want to take some of my classes and use them in another program
2013-02-18 20:10:00	TheChance	Good luck using ctrl+f to find the instance you want to change =P

2013-02-18 20:11:15	mutes	im just leading myself to the answer, sorry
2013-02-18 20:11:31	mutes	maybe a tad pedantic
2013-02-18 20:11:58	TheChance	Why deal with it, across like 650 lines, when I could have BankAccount.h at a whopping 150 lines, and CheckingAccount.h at another 200 lines, and SavingsAccount.h clocking in at 300?
2013-02-18 20:12:38	@intothev01d	why do we even have such long names. we could just start with the letter a for variables and work our way through the alphabet and so on as we need them
2013-02-18 20:12:41	TheChance	Apparently BankAccount.h is only 54 lines. This is a very primitive bank. I wouldn't trust them with my money.
2013-02-18 20:12:52	@intothev01d	would save a lot of typing

2013-02-18 20:14:56	@intothev01d	what I'm getting at is advancements led us to what works best today
2013-02-18 20:15:29	mutes	thats a philosophical concept thats almost as leaky as traditionalism
2013-02-18 20:15:44	TheChance	He has a point, C#.
2013-02-18 20:15:45	@intothev01d	i doubt you hoof it everywhere
2013-02-18 20:16:00	mutes	i wont argue about the header files any more, im not experienced enough
2013-02-18 20:16:20	@intothev01d	so my question is why doubt it
2013-02-18 20:16:20	TheChance	Trust me, when we dig into Tetris, it's gonna be about 1,000 source files.
2013-02-18 20:16:52	@intothev01d	i mean, if you had a logical argument that would cripple the use of modular well segmented code then it stands to reason, however the most logical implementation exists now
2013-02-18 20:17:40	TheChance	uuuugh. Way back before I was handed down this MBP, my mother twisted the power cord enough to cause a fault. Now I have to wiggle it for a few years and jam it into the sofa cushions and stuff just to get the laptop to take power, let alone charge.
2013-02-18 20:17:47	@intothev01d	it's not a philosopical argument to determine what works the best with what we know at this point
2013-02-18 20:17:55	TheChance	Fortunately it charges pretty reliably on my bed, but nowhere else.

2013-02-18 22:47:30	TheChance	Ooookay, that file I linked earlier has mostly improved, but every one of those while(badInput) loops, when they reach the end of the loop, just print "Bad input." forever, rather than returning control to the start of the loop.
2013-02-18 22:48:55	TheChance	If the input is bad. If the input is good they work normally.
2013-02-18 22:48:55	ElectricSheep	Well, considering that you are breaking of a switch strucutre
2013-02-18 22:48:59	ElectricSheep	*structure
2013-02-18 22:49:07	ElectricSheep	And there is no code to execute after the switch.
2013-02-18 22:49:08	ElectricSheep	You don't even have to break.
2013-02-18 22:49:23	ElectricSheep	You can just return immediately.
2013-02-18 22:51:31	TheChance	I don't follow, I thought I had to break after every case to proceed to the next one.
2013-02-18 22:51:59	ElectricSheep	I'm just saying you don't have to rely on a fallthrough.
2013-02-18 22:52:06	ElectricSheep	Because there is nothing to fallthrough to.
2013-02-18 22:53:22	ElectricSheep	Yes, you need the breaks to delineate the case logic.

2013-02-18 22:53:22	ElectricSheep	But if you have detected bad input, you can just immediately return.
2013-02-18 22:53:26	TheChance	Did not know that.
2013-02-18 22:53:33	TheChance	Err... how?
2013-02-18 22:54:07	ElectricSheep	Like where you have after case 'Y'

2013-02-18 22:54:18	ElectricSheep	badInput = 0
2013-02-18 22:54:58	ElectricSheep	After that you have a break, the switch completes, and the while loop will exit.
2013-02-18 22:55:22	ElectricSheep	You can just do a return returnVal instead of the badInput = 0.
2013-02-18 22:56:21	TheChance	But there are so many input checks nested within that while loop...
2013-02-18 22:57:22	TheChance	returnVal should simply toggle based on the Y/N input in the first input statement, whereas badInput will toggle to 0 in a variety of places. The trouble arises when it doesn't.

2013-02-18 22:58:26	TheChance	Oh.
2013-02-18 22:58:40	TheChance	That's not visible in the snippet I posted, is it?
2013-02-18 22:59:02	ElectricSheep	There could be another problem.
2013-02-18 22:59:02	ElectricSheep	isnan(i_accNum) ? cout << "Bad input.\n" : badInput = 0;
2013-02-18 22:59:02	ElectricSheep	This line here.
2013-02-18 22:59:23	compile_	Does anyone have experience with CSS?
2013-02-18 23:00:07	ElectricSheep	If I put in a garbage account number, this ternary prints out "Bad Input"
2013-02-18 23:00:07	ElectricSheep	Okay.
2013-02-18 23:00:07	TheChance	Yeah, that and its brethren are the broken functions. I thought when I wrote it that if isnan(i_accNum), it would print "Bad input.\n" and then the while loop would start over. But instead of returning to the input request, it just prints "Bad input.\n" forever.
2013-02-18 23:00:32	ElectricSheep	But then it immediately falls through to ask for an opening balance.
2013-02-18 23:00:36	TheChance	compile_: Ask your question, somebody will come along =P
2013-02-18 23:00:36	ElectricSheep	if I put in a correct balance, badInput is 0.
2013-02-18 23:00:44	compile_	ya give me a second
2013-02-18 23:00:47	ElectricSheep	So half my inputs are garbage, but the code accepts it.

2013-02-18 23:01:08	TheChance	If you put in a garbage account number, control never proceeds to ask for an opening balance.
2013-02-18 23:01:08	TheChance	It just keeps printing bad input.
2013-02-18 23:01:08	compile_	they tell me to keep it minimal and i tell them if i do it won't render for them.
2013-02-18 23:01:08	compile_	lol
2013-02-18 23:01:42	ElectricSheep	Ah, you are right.
2013-02-18 23:02:22	TheChance	Why's it doing that?
2013-02-18 23:03:40	ElectricSheep	Wait, what are you asking?
2013-02-18 23:03:50	ElectricSheep	So, if I put in a garbage account number, what is the expected behavior?
2013-02-18 23:04:07	TheChance	If you give it garbage input, badInput remains true. Therefore the while loop should continue running.
2013-02-18 23:04:22	TheChance	Therefore it should print "Please input an account number" again, and ask for input again.
2013-02-18 23:04:22	TheChance	It does not.
2013-02-18 23:04:46	ElectricSheep	What does it do instead?
2013-02-18 23:04:46	ElectricSheep	And do you have a link to the most up-to-date code
2013-02-18 23:04:46	TheChance	It just continues printing "Bad input." over and over and over, never returning control to the input stream.
2013-02-18 23:04:46	TheChance	Yeah, just a sec.
2013-02-18 23:04:49	TheChance	(That section hasn't changed, but I should upload again)

2013-02-18 23:16:16	ElectricSheep	Okay, take me through how you are testing this.
2013-02-18 23:16:16	ElectricSheep	I put together a small program using just your validation code.

2013-02-18 23:17:42	TheChance	Well, BankAccount.h contains the class, and BankAccount.cpp contains a number of primitive member functions (simple things. BankAccount::makeDeposit(double) is literally just m_accBalance += double).
2013-02-18 23:17:48	ElectricSheep	I mean when you run the program, what inputs are you giving it.
2013-02-18 23:17:51	TheChance	OH.
2013-02-18 23:17:52	TheChance	Gotcha.
2013-02-18 23:18:23	TheChance	I've tried all sorts of things. There's a top-level menu function that launches first (different source file) and I select the option for "Generic bank account", which is the class I'm trying to test now.
2013-02-18 23:18:48	ElectricSheep	To the point where you get default values.
2013-02-18 23:18:56	ElectricSheep	Creating new generic bank account.
2013-02-18 23:18:56	ElectricSheep	Default values? (Y/N)
2013-02-18 23:19:09	ElectricSheep	Requesting user input :
2013-02-18 23:19:09	TheChance	Yes. If I select default values, it proceeds correctly and prints the generic bank account menu.
2013-02-18 23:19:17	TheChance	If I select an operation (deposit, withdraw, override or quit) they all work correctly.
2013-02-18 23:19:23	ElectricSheep	so I hit 'n'
2013-02-18 23:19:24	ElectricSheep	and I get
2013-02-18 23:19:39	ElectricSheep	User elected to input own values.
2013-02-18 23:19:39	ElectricSheep	Please input an account number:
2013-02-18 23:19:39	TheChance	Yep, and if you give it any int it works.
2013-02-18 23:19:47	TheChance	Opening balance will accept any double. All of it works.
2013-02-18 23:20:02	ElectricSheep	So I'll type "abdef"
2013-02-18 23:20:03	TheChance	But if at ANY POINT in the process you give it input that it won't accept, it just starts printing "Bad input." over and over and over.
2013-02-18 23:20:19	TheChance	That goes for every single input check in the whole file.
2013-02-18 23:20:23	ElectricSheep	You see, I get
2013-02-18 23:20:24	ElectricSheep	Please input an opening balance:
2013-02-18 23:20:29	ElectricSheep	and then it immediately returns.
2013-02-18 23:20:55	TheChance	Huh. That's odd, it's working right over here. I get "Please input an opening balance: $" and I enter 20.00
2013-02-18 23:21:04	ElectricSheep	You should be aware
2013-02-18 23:21:07	ElectricSheep	isnan()
2013-02-18 23:21:23	ElectricSheep	is designed to work with floating point representations.
2013-02-18 23:21:25	TheChance	ooh.
2013-02-18 23:21:33	ElectricSheep	That being said, there is a very special value that represents NaN.
2013-02-18 23:21:50	ElectricSheep	An arbitrary input passed to it will likely not be NaN.
2013-02-18 23:22:18	TheChance	Is there by any chance an isInteger()-type function in cmath or elsewhere I should be using?
2013-02-18 23:23:07	@chance	you mean on a string?
2013-02-18 23:23:12	@chance	isDigit
2013-02-18 23:23:54	ElectricSheep	What you should be doing is checking the iostate flags.
2013-02-18 23:23:56	ElectricSheep	http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ios/ios_base/iostate/
2013-02-18 23:23:57	tamper	ElectricSheep's url: http://bit.ly/YCO9nB
2013-02-18 23:24:16	ElectricSheep	You are attempting to parse in a specific type.
2013-02-18 23:24:25	ElectricSheep	If that fails, the iostate flags will be set accordingly.
2013-02-18 23:24:33	ElectricSheep	You should use that to validate your input.
2013-02-18 23:24:51	TheChance	So if you try to cin >> integer, and cin gets 'askljnsdf', it'll toggle badbit?
2013-02-18 23:25:20	ElectricSheep	Yes.
2013-02-18 23:25:22	TheChance	I assumed that only worked for things like fstream.
2013-02-18 23:25:27	TheChance	That's fantastic. Thank you.
2013-02-18 23:25:32	ElectricSheep	Use something like if ( is.rdstate() & ifstream::failbit )
2013-02-18 23:26:03	TheChance	Think that'll solve the stuck loop?
2013-02-18 23:29:04	ElectricSheep	However
2013-02-18 23:29:10	ElectricSheep	Here is a gotcha
2013-02-18 23:29:16	TheChance	Okay. I haven't declared an input stream, so just messing around I started out by changing the if(isnan) under deposit to if(ifstream::failbit), and it was very informative.
2013-02-18 23:29:19	TheChance	Oh, go ahead.
2013-02-18 23:31:14	ElectricSheep	After you detect an error, you need to do two things to the input stream
2013-02-18 23:31:24	TheChance	Yeah.
2013-02-18 23:31:25	TheChance	That was what I meant when I said that was very informative.
2013-02-18 23:31:34	TheChance	I think part of the loop control issue may have to do with my failure to clear the input stream.
2013-02-18 23:32:10	TheChance	so it's istream.clear();, and what else?
2013-02-18 23:33:34	TheChance	flush?
2013-02-18 23:34:03	ElectricSheep	Some call to ignore()
2013-02-18 23:34:32	TheChance	instream.ignore(1); istream.clear(); or the other way around?
2013-02-18 23:36:19	TheChance	Nevermind, I figured it out. I've only done this 1400 times working with fstream.
2013-02-18 23:36:19	TheChance	Thanks.
2013-02-18 23:36:34	ElectricSheep	clear first.
2013-02-18 23:36:35	ElectricSheep	then ignore.
2013-02-18 23:37:19	ElectricSheep	ignore takes two args.
2013-02-18 23:37:20	ElectricSheep	The second being a delim
2013-02-18 23:39:40	TheChance	Yeah, I was gonna do 100,newline.
2013-02-18 23:39:50	TheChance	I'm feeling really dense, but how to I call clear and ignore when I don't have an istream object?

2013-02-18 23:57:24	mutes	im asking provoking questions because im too entrenched in the os to see it, possibly
2013-02-18 23:57:58	Moralis	Well, you know what a package manager is. I guess if it were Fedora and the user knew they had to be a poweruser to get anywhere with it, I'd understand.
2013-02-18 23:57:59	mutes	there are unsupported windows nics too im sure.
2013-02-18 23:58:01	Moralis	But tbh Fedora does a much better job of just working out of the box, at least in my experience.

2013-02-19 00:00:00	Moralis	Oh for God's sake again?
2013-02-19 00:00:03	--	Moralis is now known as TheChance
2013-02-19 00:00:22	TheChance	sorry
2013-02-19 00:00:23	mutes	how do you not notice that
2013-02-19 00:00:23	TheChance	It shouldn't be happening.
2013-02-19 00:00:27	mutes	what client
2013-02-19 00:00:28	TheChance	TheChance is my default nick and they're both registered to the same login.
2013-02-19 00:00:36	TheChance	LimeChat for Mountain Lion.
2013-02-19 00:00:59	mutes	rRAAAGH
2013-02-19 00:01:03	mutes	what is so great about osx
2013-02-19 00:01:26	TheChance	I run Mac, Linux and Windows.
2013-02-19 00:01:26	TheChance	I use them all for different purposes.
2013-02-19 00:01:26	mutes	yet youre always on a mac
2013-02-19 00:01:32	@intothev01d	TheChance: check out colloquy
2013-02-19 00:01:59	TheChance	Because I find OS X by far the easiest place to code, and that being the case, I might as well be on IRC via the laptop I'm working on.
2013-02-19 00:02:11	TheChance	Also, my MBP is portable and my desktops are not.
2013-02-19 00:02:56	mutes	but youre supporting the MAN,
2013-02-19 00:03:01	mutes	...man.
2013-02-19 00:03:28	-->	tangentstorm (~michal@108-218-151-22.lightspeed.rcsntx.sbcglobal.net) has joined #learnprogramming
2013-02-19 00:03:28	TheChance	OS X with a touchpad does all types of nifty stuff that no other system will do. If I pinch all my fingers together from the outside of the trackpad, I get a menu containing all of the apps on my computer formatted like a tablet menu, swipe through it quickly and smack an icon.
2013-02-19 00:03:48	TheChance	If I drag left from the right edge with two fingers, I get a notification center like you get on an iPhone or Android.
2013-02-19 00:03:50	TheChance	Et cetera.
2013-02-19 00:03:56	@intothev01d	yep, thats the reason I like it as well TheChance. it has some nice features
2013-02-19 00:05:10	@intothev01d	multiple desktop support i can swipe through and manage etc
2013-02-19 00:05:10	mutes	im so lonely now -_-
2013-02-19 00:05:10	@intothev01d	its not bad :D
2013-02-19 00:05:10	tangentstorm	you can do that stuff with kde desktop
2013-02-19 00:05:10	TheChance	The notification center even includes clickable notifications when I get an alert in IRC. I had tabbed out of LimeChat when intothev01d sent that message just now, and it popped up in the top right screen.
2013-02-19 00:05:10	@intothev01d	haters usually tend to end up by themselves ;)
2013-02-19 00:05:10	mutes	desktop eugenics
2013-02-19 00:05:14	TheChance	tangentstorm: Can you? I haven't used KDE in years.
2013-02-19 00:05:27	@intothev01d	tangentstorm, maybe but I've yet to see it flow as well
2013-02-19 00:05:28	tangentstorm	mutes: yes of course multiplayer is going to drive the learning curve up
2013-02-19 00:05:55	mutes	by jove, that was decades ago
2013-02-19 00:06:08	TheChance	But he still found it, courtesy the OS X Notification Center.
2013-02-19 00:06:12	TheChance	^^
2013-02-19 00:06:19	tangentstorm	TheChance: i just randomly tried kubuntu last time i was setting up a computer and it is pretty slick
2013-02-19 00:06:49	TheChance	tangentstorm: I'm supposed to be decimating the BIOS on my roommate's laptop so she can use her extended warranty before it expires. Maybe I'll throw a kubuntu CD in before I do.
2013-02-19 00:07:25	tangentstorm	evil
2013-02-19 00:07:25	TheChance	Yep.
2013-02-19 00:07:44	mutes	decimating it how?
2013-02-19 00:07:44	TheChance	I'm gonna flash it the ware from a 1998-model Compaq Presario.
2013-02-19 00:07:45	tangentstorm	it does sort of wipe out your boot loader... i found that kind of annoying
2013-02-19 00:07:50	@intothev01d	i still have about 4 months left on my ADH for the macbook. I've been tempted to have an "accident"
2013-02-19 00:08:00	TheChance	I'll run it live.
2013-02-19 00:08:05	TheChance	intothev01d: Careful. Apple's not as forgiving as Best Buy in that regard.
2013-02-19 00:08:21	@intothev01d	Apple isn't covering it, Best Buy does
2013-02-19 00:08:43	@intothev01d	its their policy/program I have
2013-02-19 00:08:55	mutes	i got a 23 inch ips from best buy for 150
2013-02-19 00:08:58	mutes	i was kind of amazed
2013-02-19 00:09:06	@intothev01d	ADH = accidental damage so I can spill shit on it and drop it etc
2013-02-19 00:09:09	@intothev01d	still covered
2013-02-19 00:09:24	@intothev01d	if i do enough damage they void it out and give me a comparable model to what I bought
2013-02-19 00:09:50	@intothev01d	or a gift card for the amount :D
2013-02-19 00:10:24	@intothev01d	I just haven't been able to morally cross the hurdle yet. feels so wrong but I mean they are a pretty terrible company… still have some time to decide
2013-02-19 00:11:53	mutes	theyre shutting them down all over the place
2013-02-19 00:12:10	mutes	or changing the layout to be more trendy
2013-02-19 00:12:40	@intothev01d	i saw they're price matching online retailers soon
2013-02-19 00:12:40	mutes	their returns were terrible at the end of last year apparently
2013-02-19 00:12:40	@intothev01d	ie Amazon
2013-02-19 00:12:40	TheChance	Alright. New problem.
2013-02-19 00:12:41	mutes	i think thats what was doing them in
2013-02-19 00:12:49	@intothev01d	yea they can't compete and they have a shitty strategy
2013-02-19 00:12:50	tangentstorm	my brother does that kind of stuff all the time. not destroying laptops, but he's constantly buying and returning things to take advantage of various deals
2013-02-19 00:13:07	@intothev01d	tangentstorm lol thats awesome
2013-02-19 00:14:02	TheChance	http://pastebin.com/U1pN5PdM
2013-02-19 00:14:14	@intothev01d	I used to work there. the most money they make is in mobile sales
2013-02-19 00:14:27	@intothev01d	hence the new mobile stores they keep creating all over the place
2013-02-19 00:14:32	TheChance	I'm currently testing the input check after you select to input your own starting values on lines 39-44.
2013-02-19 00:14:35	tangentstorm	he'll watch for crazy sales at best buy, buy up video games, then turn around and sell them at gamestop for a profit, meanwhile racking up points at both stores
2013-02-19 00:14:41	@intothev01d	nice
2013-02-19 00:14:51	TheChance	It always evaluates to badInput = 1.
2013-02-19 00:14:54	TheChance	Even when the input should be good.
2013-02-19 00:14:59	mutes	how does one sell anything at gamestop for a profit
2013-02-19 00:15:11	tangentstorm	arbitrage
2013-02-19 00:16:05	mutes	is the payout from game stop ever decent enough
2013-02-19 00:16:17	tangentstorm	they pay more for games when you're a member of their club and when you take the money as points that can only be spent there.
2013-02-19 00:16:19	@intothev01d	TheChance, where is it you then check the value of badInput?
2013-02-19 00:16:31	mutes	i remember selling super mario rpg and super metroid for "joe and mac"
2013-02-19 00:16:37	mutes	what a terrible decision
2013-02-19 00:16:52	@intothev01d	the else is line 45 where badInput = 0, but then after the while it says badInput = 1 on line 47
2013-02-19 00:17:09	TheChance	Line 45 is inside a while(badInput)
2013-02-19 00:17:15	@intothev01d	yea i know
2013-02-19 00:17:23	TheChance	If that ifelse evaluates to true, badInput remains set to 1 and the loop repeats.
2013-02-19 00:17:27	@intothev01d	are you printing the value and seeing that it's always 1?
2013-02-19 00:17:32	TheChance	Otherwise it sets badInput to 0 to break the loop.
2013-02-19 00:17:40	TheChance	Well, no I'm not, but it always prints "Bad input." and repeats the input request.
2013-02-19 00:17:48	tangentstorm	he's a video game nut and buys games all the time, so he likes to have the store credit. and apparently they'll fairly often pay more for a game than the sale price at best buy
2013-02-19 00:17:56	@intothev01d	oh i see
2013-02-19 00:18:16	tangentstorm	or toys r us, etc... he pays attention to all the little weekly deal flyers
2013-02-19 00:19:10	tangentstorm	mutes: yes but the money they pay is in store points that have to be spent at gamestop, so they're not really out anything
2013-02-19 00:19:47	TheChance	mutes: My old roommate used to bring 2 PS3 games in and sell them for enough store credit to preorder another game.
2013-02-19 00:19:50	tangentstorm	i actually want to make a little application that can track all this stuff
2013-02-19 00:20:05	TheChance	You mean Spreadsheet?
2013-02-19 00:20:17	TheChance	=P
2013-02-19 00:20:25	tangentstorm	no, i mean something that would monitor and cross-check all the prices on things
2013-02-19 00:20:50	tangentstorm	at various stores.. and look for opportunities
2013-02-19 00:21:27	@intothev01d	TheChance, try cin.fail() instead of cin.failbit
2013-02-19 00:21:32	tangentstorm	same thing for groceries and airfare and whatnot
2013-02-19 00:21:48	TheChance	intothev01d: Good call, sec
2013-02-19 00:22:17	mutes	you know ive never been able to find a static list for trade ins online
2013-02-19 00:22:22	mutes	i dont know if they publish it
2013-02-19 00:22:58	@intothev01d	that would be a very useful app tangentstorm
2013-02-19 00:23:14	tangentstorm	anyone here under 18? https://www.googlesciencefair.com/en/2013/
2013-02-19 00:23:15	tamper	http://bit.ly/XpIvXV - Title: GSF2013
2013-02-19 00:23:50	TheChance	Yeah, that was it. It would also have accepted if(cin.failbit == true)
2013-02-19 00:23:59	@intothev01d	makes sense
2013-02-19 00:24:04	TheChance	Thanks for catching that.
2013-02-19 00:24:06	@intothev01d	failbit is a value
2013-02-19 00:24:09	TheChance	yup
2013-02-19 00:24:14	@intothev01d	so it evaluates true always
2013-02-19 00:24:17	@intothev01d	np
2013-02-19 00:24:17	mutes	i ought to do some actual work
2013-02-19 00:24:24	mutes	thechance is moving even farther ahead of me
2013-02-19 00:24:44	TheChance	It's a community effort. Our mentors here are carrying me heavily.
2013-02-19 00:24:56	mutes	i didnt even know what failbit was
2013-02-19 00:25:09	@intothev01d	im passing on knowledge i gained from others way more experienced myself
2013-02-19 00:25:13	@intothev01d	thats kind of how it works
2013-02-19 00:25:14	@intothev01d	:D
2013-02-19 00:25:49	tangentstorm	not me. i've been locked in a dark room since birth. had to deduce all this stuff from first principles.
2013-02-19 00:26:07	mutes	an evil demon taught me js
2013-02-19 00:26:18	mutes	pudunts
2013-02-19 00:26:25	tangentstorm	my first words were cogito, ergo sum and then i just kind of went from there.. :)
2013-02-19 00:26:27	@intothev01d	lol
2013-02-19 00:26:43	@intothev01d	tangentstorm was borne out of source code (or so he says)
2013-02-19 00:27:16	@intothev01d	born*
2013-02-19 00:27:24	mutes	i have an eventual dream app i want to make and was thinking of calling it zeno
2013-02-19 00:27:38	@intothev01d	thats a cool name
2013-02-19 00:28:13	@intothev01d	and also apparently a heat treating blemish removal kit
2013-02-19 00:28:15	@intothev01d	lol
2013-02-19 00:28:34	mutes	(because it will use torrent protocol)
2013-02-19 00:28:42	mutes	hence the tortoise
2013-02-19 00:28:47	mutes	eh its a bad analogy.
2013-02-19 00:31:47	TheChance	The kinds of things you keep to yourself because you don't trust anybody, but when I graduate I really want to go into I/O and OS design. I want to build a Linux-based system whose primary purposes are to 1) do away with the desktop metaphor and 2) utilize other operating systems (running on vmware) as a client. I've got all types of nifty features in mind.
2013-02-19 00:32:06	TheChance	I'm telling you all this only so that I can brag about the name: wanna call it ShadOS.
2013-02-19 00:32:14	@intothev01d	too late, i just copyrighted everything you said
2013-02-19 00:32:16	@intothev01d	:D
2013-02-19 00:32:20	TheChance	damn! =P
2013-02-19 00:32:28	@intothev01d	now you have to license!
2013-02-19 00:32:35	@intothev01d	muhuhahahaha
2013-02-19 00:32:43	TheChance	if nobody's registered ShadOS in any way I'm astonished.
2013-02-19 00:32:46	TheChance	It seems so obvious.
2013-02-19 00:32:52	TheChance	Because the... virtual machines are... you know.
2013-02-19 00:32:53	mutes	do away with the desktop metaphor
2013-02-19 00:33:04	mutes	hummmmmm
2013-02-19 00:33:05	TheChance	Yeah, why do we need to pretend our computers are cubicles?
2013-02-19 00:33:13	TheChance	We're no longer trying to teach 3 billion office workers to Macintosh.
2013-02-19 00:33:20	mutes	because we're spatially oriented creatures?
2013-02-19 00:33:22	mutes	i guess
2013-02-19 00:33:31	@intothev01d	isn't that what Windows 8 is trying to do
2013-02-19 00:33:41	TheChance	Yes, but I want to do it intelligently.
2013-02-19 00:33:43	@intothev01d	abstract away all functionality ( i mean the desktop )
2013-02-19 00:33:54	@intothev01d	:D
2013-02-19 00:33:54	mutes	god those fullscreen applications
2013-02-19 00:33:54	@intothev01d	yea it could work if done well
2013-02-19 00:34:18	mutes	whoops
2013-02-19 00:34:19	TheChance	I feel like you should be able to say "Jarvis, bring up a web browser" and if you happen to be standing near the TV, it brings it up on the TV. If you're in your bedroom, it comes up on your desktop.
2013-02-19 00:34:26	TheChance	That sort of thing.
2013-02-19 00:34:27	mutes	my pdf reader blew away my multitasking
2013-02-19 00:34:50	@intothev01d	thats more like a whole home system type thing
2013-02-19 00:34:50	TheChance	Motion control: reach out and "grab" the Netflix window on your television and tuck it in your pocket. Reach into your pocket and "grab" the Netflix window, then throw it at your laptop.
2013-02-19 00:35:06	mutes	what if you want to view say...your C++ book next to your ide?
2013-02-19 00:35:06	TheChance	Yeah, I have a lot of lower-level features in mind, too, but first comes the degree and some friends.
2013-02-19 00:35:06	mutes	:P

2013-02-19 17:01:29	TheChance	Ugh. I spent like two hours yesterday trying to arrive at if(cin.fail()){cin.clear(); cin.ignore();} and, lo and behold, three months ago when I wrote this header I used it a bunch.

2013-02-19 17:02:30	mutes	what is cin.fail goddammit
2013-02-19 17:02:31	mutes	does it check against type

2013-02-19 17:02:46	TheChance	Well put!
2013-02-19 17:03:09	TheChance	Okay, so if you try to cin << integer, and the user inputs GSLKJHSDLFKJSDFLK, that can't be cast to an int very cleanly, right?
2013-02-19 17:03:34	TheChance	You'd get a really, really big number consisting of a bunch of Unicode values. Or an error. Or NaN. Or insert not what you want-type thing here.
2013-02-19 17:03:51	mutes	ah, i was right
2013-02-19 17:03:57	mutes	first time for everything
2013-02-19 17:03:58	TheChance	But input streams in C++, any input stream as it turns out, have a toggle bit. When they detect something like that, that bit toggles to "fuck you".

2013-02-19 17:05:19	TheChance	mutes: Yes. if(cin.fail()) the last input was no good. cin.ignore(somenumberofcharacters) basically gets it to the end of the input stream (if you use it right). cin.clear() then wipes out the input stream completely.
2013-02-19 17:05:32	TheChance	Then you can repeat your request for input.
2013-02-19 17:06:16	TheChance	Apparently, I usually do if(cin.fail){cin.ignore(); cin.clear(); cout << "Bad input try again: "; cin >> inputVar;}. But I couldn't come up with that last night, no sir.

2013-02-19 17:18:07	TheChance	Reusable code saves trouble. For example, the primitive cartesiangrid.h I wrote for an assignment will now be fleshed out to a great degree.

2013-02-19 17:26:15	mutes	yeah, but do we want to rotate on a block or a point
2013-02-19 17:26:18	TheChance	Meaning the square that represents the "actual" position of the tetronimo, and all its other component squares are at positions relative to that, like anchorX - 1.

2013-02-19 17:26:53	TheChance	I think when we rotate, and I might be off track here but I think this is it, we establish a rectangle surrounding the block and rotate THAT.

2013-02-19 17:31:05	TheChance	I'm not too familiar with Java, but that would be my first step in C++.
2013-02-19 17:32:15	AssTroutKnot	alright ill give it try brb thanks
2013-02-19 17:32:23	hail_kuato	its the same idea as C++. Your class 'Compute' can be instantiated (there can be many instances of Compute).. there's only one copy of a static function and it cannot refer to fields/members that are non-static
2013-02-19 17:32:55	TheChance	In which case, I don't see the benefit of making that function static, really.
2013-02-19 17:33:18	TheChance	It's just an input function, you might save a couple bytes of memory by making it static.
2013-02-19 17:34:50	hail_kuato	right. a more appropriate re-design would be the Compute class just handles the work of performing computations. you could create an instance of Compute from main(), where you would also use the scanner, and pass along input values to Compute
2013-02-19 17:35:30	TheChance	so mutes: I'm picturing an L-block with an imaginary rectangular border enclosing it. Then we rotate the whole rectangle around the "anchor square" corner.

2013-02-19 17:38:53	TheChance	that was awesome.
2013-02-19 17:39:15	TheChance	Anyway, if it consists of four squares, one of them has to be the "actual" position of the whole tetronimo.
2013-02-19 17:39:21	mutes	all tertonimos are 4 thechance, but yeah
2013-02-19 17:39:28	TheChance	The other three squares will be rendered at positions relative to that square.

2013-02-19 17:40:34	TheChance	Naw, we just make an invisible border around the block, and any necessary empty squares that fall within the rectangle. And then we rotate the whole tetronimo by moving the contents of that rectangle 90 degrees, around the anchor square.

2013-02-19 17:59:57	TheChance	Enalicho: I could have phrased that better. In order to switch on a char, it needs to be {case 'A':} not {case "A"} right?
2013-02-19 18:00:16	@Enalicho	yeaTheChance:
2013-02-19 18:00:26	@Enalicho	TheChance: Yeah, "" is a string, '' is a char
2013-02-19 18:01:21	TheChance	AssTroutKnot: Just a little tip. When you're running a switch on console input, always include cases for upper and lowercase. It's easy. On the next line after {case 'A':} just put {case 'a':} and it'll run the code on either case.
2013-02-19 18:02:11	TheChance	And it's gonna be more effective to use chars rather than strings for console input, reason being if your command is (A)dd, the user can enter "A" or "a" or "Amanda" or "analleakage" or "amazing race was a great movie".
2013-02-19 18:02:19	AssTroutKnot	so case 'A':
2013-02-19 18:02:25	AssTroutKnot	case 'a'
2013-02-19 18:03:04	TheChance	case 'A': followed by case 'a': means "case 'A' || 'a'" (which wouldn't work, so you put them on separate lines before the expression)
2013-02-19 18:03:16	TheChance	So yes, that's correct.

2013-02-19 18:05:51	AssTroutKnot	what do i put for the input before i had:   stringInput = input.nextLine();
2013-02-19 18:06:00	AssTroutKnot	but now that i have a char i don't know how to do it :/
2013-02-19 18:06:19	TheChance	I assume that you've declared "string stringInput" up above this function.
2013-02-19 18:06:28	TheChance	So instead, declare "char charInput" and make it switch(charInput).
2013-02-19 18:07:24	TheChance	Keep it as input.nextLine();. This is better than before, because if the user DOES enter "Amanda", it's gonna read that FIRST character (which is "A" and therefore valid input) and then it's gonna ignore the rest of the line.
2013-02-19 18:07:37	TheChance	Unless Java is not like C++ in this regard, but so far in this conversation there have been no substantial differences.
2013-02-19 18:07:46	AssTroutKnot	yea thats the problem
2013-02-19 18:08:01	AssTroutKnot	it doesnt let me use nextLine() for a character
2013-02-19 18:08:05	TheChance	Oh.
2013-02-19 18:08:07	TheChance	Balls.
2013-02-19 18:08:12	TheChance	Enalicho?
2013-02-19 18:08:50	TheChance	I know a very complicated way to do it involving string input and a char array, but really there has to be a simpler way.
2013-02-19 18:09:21	AssTroutKnot	i can have it be an int and have the choice of 1,2,3
2013-02-19 18:10:08	TheChance	Hey there you go.
2013-02-19 18:10:31	TheChance	But I'd really take this opportunity to learn to get input to a char and switch on it. That's an enormous help when you're making console applications with complicated menus.
2013-02-19 18:10:48	TheChance	Neither you nor the user wants to keep track of whether "1" was supposed to be "print user account information" or "make a deposit"
2013-02-19 18:11:16	TheChance	Much easier to use "(P)rint account info (D)eposit"

2013-02-19 18:18:16	TheChance	Does that work?
2013-02-19 18:19:10	TheChance	mutes: You DECLARE the methods inside the class, if they're going to be members of the class.
2013-02-19 18:19:13	TheChance	Then you DEFINE the methods in a source file.
2013-02-19 18:19:22	TheChance	You know what, I have a very tidy example. Will paste.

2013-02-19 18:20:44	AssTroutKnot	oh i fixed the calc
2013-02-19 18:21:22	AssTroutKnot	i was doing input = M and I had to switch it to M = input
2013-02-19 18:21:58	TheChance	Here is BankAccount.cpp, which is much longer. Note that it #includes "BankAccount.h", also note that there are prototypes in BankAccount.h which are NOT elaborated on in BankAccount.cpp. This is because...
2013-02-19 18:22:23	TheChance	http://pastebin.com/hQ4DkCJ5
2013-02-19 18:22:37	TheChance	http://pastebin.com/YL4cjDGK BankAccountTester.cpp contains the source code for EVERYTHING from the header that's NOT a part of the class.
2013-02-19 18:22:53	TheChance	Ideally, those things should actually be in a DIFFERENT HEADER ENTIRELY for cleanliness. My assignment required otherwise.
2013-02-19 18:23:01	TheChance	Hope this helps.
2013-02-19 18:23:22	mutes	why bother making things private
2013-02-19 18:23:25	TheChance	Imagine that I'm going to compile this into a library and distribute it to idiots around the world.
2013-02-19 18:23:45	TheChance	They're going to ruin their whole program and/or produce really ugly behaviors if they go around changing m_AccNum.
2013-02-19 18:24:08	TheChance	So I make that private, or at least protected.
2013-02-19 18:24:08	TheChance	That way, public functions that I write can mess with the variable, but users #including "BankAccount.h" can't.
2013-02-19 18:24:31	mutes	how can they go around"" doing things if it's not given to them as a function to do so
2013-02-19 18:24:52	TheChance	Well that's the point.
2013-02-19 18:24:54	TheChance	After they make an instance of BankAccount, if "m_accNum" were public, they could just do this:
2013-02-19 18:25:05	TheChance	thisAccount.m_AccNum = 500
2013-02-19 18:25:15	mutes	arent they changing it through the public methods anyway?
2013-02-19 18:25:28	TheChance	Yes, but only in the manner we've created.
2013-02-19 18:25:28	mutes	one sec
2013-02-19 18:25:49	TheChance	This is where the example falls apart because there's really nothing in BankAccount that shouldn't be screwed with. However, functions are public() by convention and if you don't have to make a variable public, there's no good reason to.
2013-02-19 18:26:09	TheChance	Imagine it's something much more sensitive, like pi.
2013-02-19 18:26:28	TheChance	Pi would be private so some nefarious/stupid programmer didn't do "thisObject.pi = 1;"
2013-02-19 18:26:49	TheChance	And there would be no function which altered pi, ever.
2013-02-19 18:27:30	TheChance	So pi is safe, because it's private. You might make it protected instead, so that functions can read it but not write to it. Either way, you don't want it to be public.
2013-02-19 18:28:49	TheChance	Note that functions which are a member of the class can totally read private variables, but user functions won't be able to. It's very neat and tidy.
2013-02-19 18:28:50	mutes	so just const pi, why make it a variable
2013-02-19 18:29:05	TheChance	const pi is still a variable.
2013-02-19 18:29:10	mutes	you know what i mean
2013-02-19 18:29:28	TheChance	Yeah, I do.
2013-02-19 18:29:44	mutes	so,
2013-02-19 18:30:11	mutes	private is there simpy to -indicate- that it's contents shouldnt be touched
2013-02-19 18:30:18	mutes	SIMPY
2013-02-19 18:30:19	mutes	ugh
2013-02-19 18:30:27	TheChance	No.
2013-02-19 18:31:08	TheChance	Private variables can never, ever be access from outside of the class code itself (there are ways around that, but you'd have to do it yourself. Remember that you're going to deploy your classes in libs and stuff like that most of the time)
2013-02-19 18:31:25	TheChance	A const variable keeps YOU from changing it later in the same program.
2013-02-19 18:31:45	AssTroutKnot	alright program is done :)
2013-02-19 18:31:45	AssTroutKnot	thanks a bunch!
2013-02-19 18:32:10	TheChance	Which is to say, if I do "const pi = 3.141592" in circle.cpp, I cannot later in circle.cpp decide to do "pi = 472.8". If I make it a private member of a class, NO source file will be able to do ANYTHING to its value.
2013-02-19 18:33:03	TheChance	Seems to me there'd be some benefit to making it "private: const pi" so that you can't change it from inside OR outside of your source.
2013-02-19 18:33:55	TheChance	Anyway, const protects you against yourself and private: protects everyone else who uses your code against themselves. That's the difference. I should've just said that in the first place.

2013-02-19 18:46:26	mutes	so i figure when blocks hit the bottom, we'll have some algorithm for breaking up that particular instance and making them a part of 'bottom', right?
2013-02-19 18:46:49	mutes	so that new instances interact with them as if they were part of the static grid
2013-02-19 18:46:57	TheChance	Yeah, I think they'll break into a vector of some kind.
2013-02-19 18:47:02	mutes	and line wipes will also interact with 'bottom'
2013-02-19 18:47:33	TheChance	Vector will house as many rows as currently exist at the bottom, each of which contains a bunch of boolean X-values which are just "square is full" or "square is empty"
2013-02-19 18:48:01	TheChance	And then if every square in the row is full, it wipes the row out and drops the rest of the board a row.
2013-02-19 18:48:55	mutes	i guess collision detection will be 'is square empty'
2013-02-19 18:49:26	TheChance	Is (X,Y-1) empty ? keep going : collision
2013-02-19 18:50:15	TheChance	collision() will probably resize vector<bool> bottomRows to suit and then kill the Tetronimo object and turn it into members of the vector.
2013-02-19 18:51:04	TheChance	Speaking of which! Mentors: so far, every time I've tried to include a destructor, I get compile errors on the line that defines the default constructor.

2013-02-19 19:58:12	Z_Mass	Well it's nice and quick, if you use something like tmux or even just solarized, you can switch between editing and compiling quickly
2013-02-19 19:58:28	TheChance	But I don't have to switch between anything. It's all in the same window.
2013-02-19 19:58:48	Z_Mass	Do you know all the keyboard shortcuts?
2013-02-19 19:58:52	TheChance	I dunno. I understand that many people prefer it, but to me it seems like doing your graphing on paper with an abacus, when you have a TI-89 sitting right there.
2013-02-19 19:58:59	TheChance	For Vim or for my IDE?
2013-02-19 19:59:03	Z_Mass	Your IDE
2013-02-19 19:59:03	TheChance	(no, yes)
2013-02-19 19:59:10	TheChance	Yes.
2013-02-19 19:59:26	TheChance	Well, most of them. I periodically discover something nifty. I'm still learning the debugger.
2013-02-19 19:59:28	Z_Mass	Once you learn even a few vim commands, it's really quick for editing
2013-02-19 19:59:43	TheChance	Haven't had a need for it, I'm pretty good about including console output on a program flag.
2013-02-19 19:59:53	TheChance	I'm sure the Tetris project will be my big introduction to the debugger.
2013-02-19 20:00:50	TheChance	I'll give it a try, seems like a good learning experience, but I'm skeptical.
2013-02-19 20:01:26	Z_Mass	I'm not sure what console output has to do with editing, but you should try vim out one day. Just remap Esc to jj and you're life will be easier though lol
2013-02-19 20:01:29	TheChance	I have this vivid memory of my physics professor coming in and saying, "Good morning. THIS is a slide rule. When I was your age, this was all we had. Ten years ago, we taught students to use these because 'You won't always have a calculator,' we said. Well, ladies and gentlemen..." and he cracked the thing in two over his knee.
2013-02-19 20:02:06	TheChance	Oh. Console output to isolate errors when my program is running -v. So far, that's been able to find anything I'd use the debugger for, which is good, because I do not understand how to use the debugger yet.

2013-02-19 20:03:12	Kelet	simple stuff
2013-02-19 20:03:42	Kelet	I guess I throw valgrind in there for smaller projects. Once you start using other people's libraries and getting large however it seems relatively fruitless to care too much about leaking memory; although, still useful for other errors or large leaks
2013-02-19 20:03:48	TheChance	See, it's how to set up breakpoints and use them to locate problems that I don't get. Stepthrough is pretty obvious, on its own, but when I tried to use it I noticed that it didn't do anything and moved on.

2013-02-19 20:04:30	Kelet	Generally I just set a breakpoint on a piece of code, and then when it hits the offending piece of code, I investigate variables and such to get a whiff of the environment
2013-02-19 20:04:48	Kelet	GDB for example supports breakpoints to only activate when a variable is a certain value, which is really nice
2013-02-19 20:05:32	Kelet	Dealing with some more involved data structures such as B-trees, and what of your nodes is null when it shouldn't be, you can just set GDB to break on line $x when variable $y is null, and then see why. In fact, some architectures actually support REWINDING your code in a debugger - hah.
2013-02-19 20:06:13	Kelet	But overall one of the best debugging tools is just using print statements.
2013-02-19 20:06:13	Kelet	Which is why I'm normally just using it to see stack traces, i.e., 'bt' or 'where'
2013-02-19 20:06:48	Z_Mass	TheChance: What are you going to use to make that Tetris game?
2013-02-19 20:07:30	Kelet	I actually built a Tetris game about a year ago. It's a great little exercise.

2013-02-19 20:08:16	Kelet	I started by implementing the game using data structures and just repeatedly printing the grid in ASCII. Then I used a library called SFML for C++ to draw some neat graphics. Even added some basic particle effects.
2013-02-19 20:08:55	Z_Mass	I'm starting a little snake clone in SFML actually. Kelet: Have you heard of Thor for SFML?
2013-02-19 20:09:05	TheChance	Z_Mass: I'm working with mutes and potentially whoever else is interested, hopefully with a mentor, on the LP github. So I'm obviously going to be doing SOME work on the command line, just because git. But I was going to use C::B or, if it keeps crashing on my laptop, something like CodeLite or Netbeans.
2013-02-19 20:10:03	TheChance	Kelet: I have never worked with graphics before. This is a big high-dive jump for me. mutes too.
2013-02-19 20:10:22	Z_Mass	Oh I meant like SDL or SFML, lol :P But that sounds cool, I may be interested in that if my school work doesn't get too hectic
2013-02-19 20:11:15	TheChance	Z_Mass: SDL.
2013-02-19 20:11:29	TheChance	Also something we've never worked with.
2013-02-19 20:11:40	TheChance	I'm just to the point where I'm comfortable engaging a project like this.
2013-02-19 20:11:42	Z_Mass	If you're not too invested in SDL, I would recommend SFML2. 
2013-02-19 20:11:54	TheChance	Why's that? We have no experience with either.
2013-02-19 20:12:13	TheChance	Honestly I think we've been leaning toward SDL because mutes found a great idiot-proof tutorial for it, and likely for no other reason.
2013-02-19 20:12:15	Z_Mass	I have to use SDL for school, and it's not the nicest to work with. It's a C library as well.
2013-02-19 20:13:07	hg341	z_mass you have any sfml tutorial links handy?
2013-02-19 20:13:19	TheChance	Regarding a cross-platform game, do either of those handle the transition between X and Direct easily?
2013-02-19 20:13:36	TheChance	If not we'll just write for Windows.
2013-02-19 20:13:40	TheChance	(I assume)
2013-02-19 20:13:51	Kelet	Z_Mass: No I haven't
2013-02-19 20:14:12	Z_Mass	SFML is cross platform. hg341 Ya one second :)
2013-02-19 20:14:14	Kelet	TheChance: Use SDL if you're programming it in C, SFML is much nicer for C++
2013-02-19 20:14:34	Kelet	and if you use SDL or SFML they'll both work on on most platforms as long as you don't use anything else platform dependent
2013-02-19 20:14:53	TheChance	Well, that's two endorsements and probably settled. I think mutes is idle, so I'll go put it in the notes...

2013-02-19 20:15:49	Kelet	I find the best way to draw graphics for a game like Tetris is to just update your data structure representation of the game (likely a 2d array or similar), and then have an algorithm that draws a screen for the 2D array for each frame. For example, if your blocks are 256x256, you can calculate where to put a block graphically by just doing  position in the array * 256 for both x and y, etc

2013-02-19 20:16:47	hg341	s/it/them
2013-02-19 20:17:12	Kelet	ofc you will need another level of abstraction to allow your game to have different colored pieces and such, some notion of a "piece", basically
2013-02-19 20:17:14	Z_Mass	Kelet: Thor has a bunch of handy stuff, the big one for me was the event system. You can map multiple sf::Events to a thor::Action and then you can set up a call back for the action(s)
2013-02-19 20:17:28	TheChance	Kelet: That sounds simpler than the solutions we've been discussing. We've been talking about having a vector<bool> for the row(s) at the bottom, horizontally identifying which squares in a row are full. When a row fills up, the array is resized and the row goes away. When a collision is detected, the tetronimo's destructor is invoked, and its current state is added to the vector.
2013-02-19 20:17:58	Z_Mass	Combine that with lambdas and the event handling code is super clean. Then you just have a single call to process all callbacks.
2013-02-19 20:18:07	Kelet	Well
2013-02-19 20:18:12	Kelet	One solution could be
2013-02-19 20:18:18	TheChance	Tetronimos being class objects derived from a generic Class Tetronimo and containing (X,Y) positions for each square they contain, a facing, and other relevant info.
2013-02-19 20:18:25	mutes	oh god its becoming too big for me 0_o
2013-02-19 20:18:36	TheChance	mutes: Don't be scared, that's the whole point of the project =P
2013-02-19 20:18:39	mutes	i guess ill just wait for the next group
2013-02-19 20:18:53	TheChance	Nuh uh. This is your baby. You started it =P
2013-02-19 20:19:18	Kelet	You have a grid representing the "game board", and then you have an array of "pieces" and you just intersect them all to make the game. But you sound like you have a relatively decent solution, and you're making the data structures & design before working on graphics or anything which is a good decision for a game like Tetris :)
2013-02-19 20:19:20	Z_Mass	TheChance: SFML has a Sprite class which would be very handy.
2013-02-19 20:20:04	Kelet	One of my favorite "newbie projects" which isn't really a newbie project
2013-02-19 20:20:10	Kelet	was a Roguelike, dungeon-crawler game
2013-02-19 20:20:16	Kelet	the random map generation was fun as heck to work on
2013-02-19 20:20:27	TheChance	The main reason I thought to do it with a Tetronimo class rather than starting from a Class Grid was simply that I have functions lying around to store an object's position on a grid, but not for a "grid" object itself yet.
2013-02-19 20:21:03	TheChance	And if the code already exists, why not Zoidberg?
2013-02-19 20:21:08	Kelet	I had an algorithm for creating and connecting polygon-based rooms
2013-02-19 20:21:13	Kelet	pretty standard algorithms
2013-02-19 20:21:22	Z_Mass	Kelet: You have any of that map generating stuff on github by chance?
2013-02-19 20:21:25	Kelet	but then I made my own approach using finite automatons to make cave-like areas and such
2013-02-19 20:21:47	TheChance	Good God, Z_Mass, you just pinged me AND chance and you weren't talking to either of us =P sucks having a word for a first name sometimes.
2013-02-19 20:22:02	Kelet	Z_Mass: Unfortunately not, twas a while back and the code is lost. This was before Github and such were around. If you wanna talk about the algorithms though, I'm always down
2013-02-19 20:22:15	Kelet	Although there's tons of information available on the subject
2013-02-19 20:22:20	Z_Mass	lol my bad, I realized right after pressing enter
2013-02-19 20:22:39	Kelet	I was actually thinking about making a 3d world using fractals, I've always been interested in world simulation and random processes
2013-02-19 20:23:08	Z_Mass	I'll have to take you up on that offer some day. I remember wanting to do something with world generation before but I can't remember what it was now.
2013-02-19 20:23:09	Kelet	In fact, one of the first programs I ever made was a Mandelbrot viewer, man it was sooooo cool to have infinite complexity from ~50 lines of code. Then I started on coloring algorithms and infinite zoom

2013-02-19 20:27:19	Kelet	 Z_Mass: To copy the crux of it:
2013-02-19 20:27:20	Kelet	I just completed a semester long group project using Processing primarily. I created a game that marred together a fairly extensive user-interface with a graphical component (the game). I used the Processing IDE & language to rapidly prototype features and such (like particle effects), and then integrated it into my Java code. My Java code basically had a PApplet (the main component of a Processing project) integrated into a JPanel. My interface was
2013-02-19 20:27:20	Kelet	basically a tabbed Desktop application, with the game inside of one of the tabs.
2013-02-19 20:27:20	Kelet	Overall this approach was great, because I didn't have to re-program UI elements in Processing, and while there Processing libraries that can do this, none are nearly as mature or featureful as AWT, Swing, or SWT. Converting Processing code to Java was a cinch, and didn't take any time. It was obviously also nice to use my standard IDE (Eclipse) for the project, because while the Processing IDE is nice for rapid development, it doesn't have much code
2013-02-19 20:27:20	Kelet	 analysis features and doesn't organize well for larger projects.
2013-02-19 20:28:15	Kelet	I nominate Quassel. It has a server/client model with a nice GUI. Meaning, you can have a server with the actual IRC chats/connections, and then have a client running on your desktop, workplace, or laptop.. all at the same time if you want. It's very similar to screen + irssi or weechat only with a GUI. Although some people prefer the console stuff
2013-02-19 20:28:38	Kelet	Just saying, it exists, and it's good for people who want to access IRC from many locations with a nice GUI
2013-02-19 20:28:55	TheChance	That's... I want that. I wonder if there's a Mac binary or if I'll have to break out xterm.
2013-02-19 20:29:39	Kelet	Quassel is cross-platform Windows/Mac/Linux but it uses QT4 so it won't look shiny like cocoa apps
2013-02-19 20:29:47	Z_Mass	TheChance: I try to stick to cli apps when I can. Fits in better with my wm. Kelet I used to use Quassel when I was running KDE, it was pretty nice actually.

2013-02-19 21:27:35	mutes	TheChance, 4 dimensional arrays for the blocks?
2013-02-19 21:27:36	-->	spkwd (~spkwd@c-75-73-14-197.hsd1.mn.comcast.net) has joined #learnprogramming
2013-02-19 21:28:21	TheChance	mutes: I think two dimensional arrays (int[4,4]) containing the X and Y locations of each square within the tetronimo. But if you have a more effective idea, I'm down.
2013-02-19 21:28:36	TheChance	It seems easy enough to implement on a class for each block type, though.
2013-02-19 21:29:06	TheChance	If the corner of a left-L is the anchor, the whole tetronimo's "position" would be the location of the corner piece.
2013-02-19 21:29:46	mutes	i dont, that's how im writing it now
2013-02-19 21:29:51	TheChance	Depending on its facing, we'd implement the array beginning from the short side as (Xpos-1,ypos), then (xpos,ypos), then (xpos,ypos+1) and lastly (xpos,ypos+2)
2013-02-19 21:30:04	TheChance	That's if it's facing up with the short side facing left.
2013-02-19 21:30:18	mutes	but if we made a 10d array and the tetronimos as 4d arrays, we could 'draw' them on
2013-02-19 21:30:46	-->	Kelet (~Phenax@70.118.74.75) has joined #learnprogramming
2013-02-19 21:30:47	TheChance	Yeah, but then we have to do a lot of messing around in the 10d array for every frame.
2013-02-19 21:31:03	TheChance	Makes more sense to me to have a vector for blocks that don't move anymore and a 2D array for the block that is currently moving.
2013-02-19 21:31:29	mutes	yeah just an idea
2013-02-19 21:31:31	mutes	not like i have much code down
2013-02-19 21:31:40	mutes	rotating blocks is just bothering me
2013-02-19 21:32:14	TheChance	It's going to take some thought about how each of those arrays needs to change when a block rotates.
2013-02-19 21:32:14	TheChance	But it still seems like the easiest way to wrap our heads around.
2013-02-19 21:32:31	TheChance	Think of it this way: the ONLY square that matters is the anchor square.
2013-02-19 21:32:47	TheChance	The other three squares are located using a function that looks at where the anchor is, and which way the block is supposed to be facing.
2013-02-19 21:33:12	mutes	then it's all offset, yeah
2013-02-19 21:33:12	TheChance	So the way I described above is how a left-L faces up, and then we need three more for the other three facings, and it's done.
2013-02-19 21:33:12	mutes	checking that offset for collisons during rotation though
2013-02-19 21:35:12	<--	kumul (~mool@c-76-26-237-95.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2013-02-19 21:35:12	TheChance	That seems easy enough. When you run LeftL::rotateBlock(counter-clockwise), it does if(theSquareInQuestion == occupied){do not rotate block} and then move on to the rest of it.
2013-02-19 21:35:22	TheChance	Just a call to the vector.
2013-02-19 21:35:47	mutes	well i should be able to rotate still
2013-02-19 21:36:05	TheChance	Not always. If a right-hand block is up against a wall to its left, it can't rotate counter-clockwise.
2013-02-19 21:36:12	TheChance	Well.
2013-02-19 21:36:14	mutes	yeah
2013-02-19 21:36:15	TheChance	I should say between two walls, but you get my meaning.
2013-02-19 21:36:15	mutes	see
2013-02-19 21:36:53	mutes	you can rotate while against the wall, though, so you cant rotate on the anchor any more
2013-02-19 21:37:14	mutes	you have to push it out
2013-02-19 21:37:35	TheChance	I don't follow.

2013-02-19 21:40:53	TheChance	spkwd: There is a tremendous amount of debate regarding where you should start: a scripting language or not, C or C++, or should it be Java?
2013-02-19 21:41:14	TheChance	For me, it makes sense to start with Java or C++ because they utilize the same basic syntax.

2013-02-19 21:44:10	TheChance	Well come here next time!
2013-02-19 21:44:10	hg341	the cause was i forgot a semicolon after a class
2013-02-19 21:44:20	hg341	nah i just googled it and found the answer in five seconds
2013-02-19 21:44:49	TheChance	Yeah see we help each other with that stuff, usually very quickly =P pastebin your code and your compiler errors, ask the question and camp out.
2013-02-19 21:45:09	TheChance	mutes: Wall kick could be handled a number of ways. Perhaps Class Block should have a bool isAgainstWall?
2013-02-19 21:45:20	TheChance	Then every frame we just check its position and toggle that bool if necessary.
2013-02-19 21:45:29	mutes	lemme see class block again
2013-02-19 21:45:30	mutes	i think im writing against you
2013-02-19 21:45:30	TheChance	I haven't written it yet.
2013-02-19 21:45:51	TheChance	No, I'm not writing right now.
2013-02-19 21:45:51	mutes	thats just cartesian right
2013-02-19 21:45:51	TheChance	We need to set up the project in git.
2013-02-19 21:46:04	mutes	im using class 'tetro'
2013-02-19 21:46:04	TheChance	The cartesian functions were just old functions I had laying around to give an object X,Y attributes and a facing, and to modify them.
2013-02-19 21:46:04	mutes	i guess block makes more sense
2013-02-19 21:46:07	spkwd	This might have to go to linux, but is there a way to change the color scheme in nano?
2013-02-19 21:46:09	TheChance	Actually, I created a Tetronimo.h
2013-02-19 21:46:15	TheChance	and Class Tetronimo. But it has no code in it.
2013-02-19 21:46:27	mutes	yeah spkwd, though i cant remember how
2013-02-19 21:46:37	TheChance	I figured we'd do Class LeftL : public Tetronimo, and so forth
2013-02-19 21:46:49	mutes	i have grid.h, floor.h and tetro.h
2013-02-19 21:47:18	TheChance	That works. Nothing really stops us from changing filenames anyway.
2013-02-19 21:47:18	TheChance	If we feel compelled at some point.
2013-02-19 21:47:34	TheChance	Let's get git set up so that we CAN work against each other and it'll just fork until we fix it.
2013-02-19 21:47:39	mutes	Class LeftL : public Tetronimo? what is that doing
2013-02-19 21:48:01	TheChance	Class Name : public SomeOtherClass creates a child class derived from the parent class (the second one)
2013-02-19 21:48:20	TheChance	It inherits everything from the parent class, unless you override a function or variable with a new declaration and definition in the new class.
2013-02-19 21:48:21	mutes	oh dammit i forgot to read the inheritance chapter
2013-02-19 21:48:31	TheChance	Well, that's the whole chapter there, pretty much.
2013-02-19 21:48:43	mutes	:|
2013-02-19 21:49:10	mutes	you say that, but when youre like 'theyre structs with blah' you didnt mention constructors and overloads an unions
2013-02-19 21:49:10	TheChance	public: and protected: members can be modified by the child, private: members can't unless you do a little bit of extra work to get around that.
2013-02-19 21:49:10	mutes	theres... a lot of stuff
2013-02-19 21:49:51	TheChance	Yeah, that's fair enough, but inheritance really works the way you'd expect it to work in OO programming, with very few caveats.
2013-02-19 21:49:51	TheChance	At least as far as I've gotten with it so far.

2013-02-19 22:18:34	TheChance	I've tried a little Ruby at one of those tutorial sites and I really, really liked it.
2013-02-19 22:18:34	TheChance	It speaks English.
2013-02-19 22:19:43	ElectricSheep	Like in objective-c, you can define your own Employee object that might have a member called "salary"
2013-02-19 22:19:43	ElectricSheep	You can put a bunch of Employees into an NSArray.
2013-02-19 22:20:28	ElectricSheep	And if you want to find the average salary of those employees, you don't have to bother with loops and an iterator.
2013-02-19 22:21:08	ElectricSheep	You can just do [employees valueForKeyPath:@"@avg.salary"]; directly.
2013-02-19 22:21:08	mutes	whats your username TheChance
2013-02-19 22:21:20	TheChance	TheChance. I haven't forked yet, I'm doing the tutorial again since this is my first practical experience with git and my short-term memory is lousy.
2013-02-19 22:21:51	mutes	i didnt like that tutorial
2013-02-19 22:21:51	ElectricSheep	@avg is a collection operator, and .salary is a keyPath.
2013-02-19 22:21:56	mutes	the 4 part git one is much quicker and to the point
2013-02-19 22:21:57	ElectricSheep	As long as you adhere to naming conventions with accessor methods, or use the @property keyword, it all just works.
2013-02-19 22:22:43	ElectricSheep	And with some pointer swizzling magic, it is also possible to declare your own collection operators.
2013-02-19 22:22:51	ElectricSheep	So you can do something like
2013-02-19 22:22:52	ElectricSheep	NSArray *albumCovers = [records valueForKeyPath:@"[collect].{artist like 'Bon Iver'}.<NSUnarchiveFromDataTransformerName>.albumCoverImageData"];
2013-02-19 22:23:51	ElectricSheep	Which filters a record collection for artists whose name matches 'Bon Iver' and initializes an NSImage object from the album cover image data.
2013-02-19 22:23:51	ElectricSheep	Into an array.
2013-02-19 22:24:09	mutes	but why would anyone do that ElectricSheep

2013-02-19 23:21:40	TheChance	We can have it always be [0][0], and then use documentation to keep track of how right-angle tetronimos fit together.
2013-02-19 23:22:08	TheChance	We can choose the one that makes the most sense so that we start with the short end of a right-angle, for example, and count through the corner piece (which would be the anchor) up to the long end.
2013-02-19 23:22:15	TheChance	And keep track of THAT using documentation.

2013-02-19 23:24:13	TheChance	It's probably not worth worrying about RIGHT off the bat, but I'll send you a link to the documentation system I like. It's very, very easy to learn and use, and it puts out clickable HTML documentation and man pages both.
2013-02-19 23:24:30	mutes	documentation != commenting?
2013-02-19 23:25:11	TheChance	Well, the documentation is created using comments. You put certain keywords on each line, very easy to learn. @brief <brief description of function below> @param xLoc <description of parameter and acceptable input> and so forth.
2013-02-19 23:25:12	mutes	do you have something to push atm
2013-02-19 23:25:16	TheChance	I do not, push away
2013-02-19 23:25:39	TheChance	The benefit of that is that you can read it while coding, but if you get super confused you can also go read the man page.
2013-02-19 23:25:52	TheChance	Which formats all those comments together and links them, if you use the HTML version
2013-02-19 23:26:07	mutes	is this some sort of plugin

2013-02-20 12:06:06	viiralvx	oh, okay
2013-02-20 12:07:00	viiralvx	So I'm doing domain name checking, it says that the name must start with an alphabetic character, then can be followed by any number of alphabetic chars and periods, but every two periods must have at least 1 alphabetic character between them, and then it ends in a period with 2, 3, or 4 alphabetic characters
2013-02-20 12:09:48	viiralvx	So I'm doing this in Python, so far this is what I got: domain_regex = re.compile(r'\A[a-zA-z][a-zA-Z.]*.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}')
2013-02-20 12:10:13	viiralvx	but I don't really know how to check that between two periods, there is at least 1 alphabetic character . . .

2013-02-20 12:13:57	viiralvx	Between platforms?

2013-02-20 12:15:06	viiralvx	In my experience, Qt is more portable in terms of graphics/compatibility than other graphics libraries such as SDL, I've worked on Qt projects on my Mac OS X and then turned it in on LInux and it's worked.
2013-02-20 12:15:25	viiralvx	Hmmm, I don't know about in that case. I've only worked between Mac OS X and UNIX . . .

2013-02-20 16:02:56	@chance	ah, i see.
2013-02-20 16:03:59	FRodrigues	ElectricSheep, what two ways?
2013-02-20 16:05:26	ElectricSheep	Well, since you are individually allocating the space needed for each Address row, you could iterate over all of your rows, dereferencing their pointers and writing the data out to the file one at a time.
2013-02-20 16:05:53	ElectricSheep	Followed by the database rows array
2013-02-20 16:06:01	ElectricSheep	And the max_data and max_rows values.
2013-02-20 16:07:01	ElectricSheep	Serializing each individually allocated component, and then you would have to do the same thing in reverse when you want to load.
2013-02-20 16:07:07	ElectricSheep	Reading in each component and allocating space for it.
2013-02-20 16:07:12	ElectricSheep	That is one way
2013-02-20 16:07:16	ElectricSheep	But
2013-02-20 16:07:38	FRodrigues	yes
2013-02-20 16:07:49	ElectricSheep	Since the size of the database is governed by two parameters, you can calculated just how much memory the database can possibly occupy.
2013-02-20 16:07:56	ElectricSheep	Allocate all of that space in one shot.

2013-02-20 16:08:30	ElectricSheep	And construct the pointers to name and email using arithmetic
2013-02-20 16:08:41	ElectricSheep	So that they will reside in the singular contiguous address space.
2013-02-20 16:08:49	ElectricSheep	Which you can then serialize out in one shot.
2013-02-20 16:08:53	ElectricSheep	But you will have to swizzle pointers.
2013-02-20 16:09:23	FRodrigues	swizzle?
2013-02-20 16:09:35	ElectricSheep	Converting the pointers *name and *email to an offset from the beginning of the contiguous block.
2013-02-20 16:09:43	ElectricSheep	Writing out the actual pointers is meaningless.
2013-02-20 16:09:56	ElectricSheep	Because when you need to load them back, things will not be laid out the same way.
2013-02-20 16:10:04	FRodrigues	yeah
2013-02-20 16:10:43	ElectricSheep	Swizzling means converting them to a value that you can use to remap everything, even if addresses change.
2013-02-20 16:11:14	ElectricSheep	So what you can do is malloc() two large blocks of memory.
2013-02-20 16:12:00	ElectricSheep	One of them being max_rows * sizeof( struct Address ) in size.
2013-02-20 16:12:43	ElectricSheep	And the other being max_data * sizeof( char ) * 2 in size.
2013-02-20 16:12:45	ElectricSheep	The first region will be where you keep all of your Addresses.
2013-02-20 16:12:54	ElectricSheep	The second space will be where you keep all of the strings for name and email.
2013-02-20 16:14:08	FRodrigues	yeah
2013-02-20 16:15:15	ElectricSheep	As long as you have a base address for these blocks, you can derive the effective address for each Address.name and Address.email.

2013-02-20 16:17:59	ElectricSheep	So if my base address is at 12340, and max_data is 256, then the first Address name will be at 12340, the first Address email will be at 12340 + 256, the second address name will be at 12340 + 512, the second address email will be at 12340 + 768, etc
2013-02-20 16:18:44	ElectricSheep	When you save the data, all you have to do to swizzle the pointers is subtract the base address from each name or email pointer.
2013-02-20 16:19:30	ElectricSheep	This is easier to explain with pictures.
2013-02-20 16:19:31	FRodrigues	I understood
2013-02-20 16:20:26	ElectricSheep	So instead of having to malloc() max_rows of names and addresses, you just malloc() a big chunk and manage how its sliced up yourself.
2013-02-20 16:23:47	ElectricSheep	Since you are allocated max_rows and max_data up front anyways, the database is no less efficient in how its using memory.

2013-02-23 17:53:50	ario	what?
2013-02-23 17:53:57	ario	guess away :)
2013-02-23 17:54:23	tangentstorm	OK: it's important to keep your objects loosely coupled... this means that you can reason about them in isolation as units... (as in unit testing)
2013-02-23 17:55:06	ario	ah
2013-02-23 17:55:21	tangentstorm	so you might want to write a program that deals with speeding tickets... Say a DmvClerk class
2013-02-23 17:55:41	ario	so it doesn't want something along the lines of 'private PoliceOfficer officer' ?
2013-02-23 17:55:57	tangentstorm	that could be running on a completely separate computer or something, but it might very well make use of a serialized version of this Ticket class
2013-02-23 17:56:05	tangentstorm	right
2013-02-23 17:56:15	TheChance	I think it means you should make sure you aren't storing a PoliceOfficer object inside of your ParkingTicket, or passing one to it as reference, but rather just pass it variables, and then in main() or some intermediate function, pass it those variables instead. That's what I think it means.
2013-02-23 17:56:27	TheChance	Err, sorry tangentstorm, wasn't paying attention while I typed.
2013-02-23 17:56:38	tangentstorm	or like... what if you get the ticket from a camera at a traffic light? there might not be a specific officer.

2013-02-23 17:57:49	ario	hmm
2013-02-23 17:57:57	tangentstorm	It just means have a field for the name and a field for the badge number but don't keep a reference back to the police officer. like you just said.
2013-02-23 17:58:12	TheChance	You might store the info you need from PoliceObject on an intermediary variable or something.
2013-02-23 17:59:44	ario	so i can't do public void setOfficer(Policeofficer o) and then make acopy of the object reference by o -- officer = new PoliceOfficer(o); ??
2013-02-23 18:00:01	TheChance	Well, that's what I WOULD do, but I think that's what you're being told not to do.
2013-02-23 18:00:17	ario	yeah ok
2013-02-23 18:00:17	ario	lol
2013-02-23 18:01:26	tangentstorm	because this is a design flaw :)
2013-02-23 18:01:58	tangentstorm	which might be counterintuitive if you've ever done anything with relational databases

2013-02-23 18:02:22	tangentstorm	because in a relational database, you would very much want to just keep one officer_id field
2013-02-23 18:02:34	ario	yeah
2013-02-23 18:02:46	tangentstorm	but when talking about objects, you don't want this
2013-02-23 18:03:16	tangentstorm	i'm trying to put into words why
2013-02-23 18:03:47	tangentstorm	in the database, the goal is to avoid duplicating data
2013-02-23 18:04:26	ario	yeah the process of normalization of data
2013-02-23 18:04:28	tangentstorm	because if you keep a copy and the officer changes their name later, you now have to go update a zillion records all over the place
2013-02-23 18:05:21	ario	so can i do this instead:: Private PoliceOfficer officer // then send the info through the constructor?
2013-02-23 18:05:34	ario	that's not storing a policeOfficer object
2013-02-23 18:05:42	TheChance	My battery is about to die, but int officer_ID = PoliceOfficer.m_officer_ID; and pass it to ParkingTicket::getOfficerID(int).
2013-02-23 18:05:45	tangentstorm	there are object databases out there, but most of the world uses relational databases (or nosql databases these days)
2013-02-23 18:05:51	TheChance	Or a constructor with params would work.
2013-02-23 18:06:04	ario	sweet
2013-02-23 18:06:16	tangentstorm	and then you connect the database to the object with an object-relational mapper.
2013-02-23 18:06:25	ario	this is just java programming OOP
2013-02-23 18:06:29	TheChance	Dear God I hope I get to the charger before it dies, I need this explanation
2013-02-23 18:06:34	ario	no databases involved
2013-02-23 18:06:37	ario	:)
2013-02-23 18:06:44	 *	TheChance raises hand.
2013-02-23 18:06:49	mutes	you better TheChance
2013-02-23 18:06:50	TheChance	We have databases.
2013-02-23 18:07:01	mutes	because all of our copy/pastes are broken
2013-02-23 18:07:01	mutes	so youll be fucked
2013-02-23 18:07:08	TheChance	Wat.
2013-02-23 18:07:13	TheChance	I've only been asleep for 8 hours.
2013-02-23 18:07:13	tangentstorm	anyway the objects are kind of transient things in memory. there aren't millions of copies to change.
2013-02-23 18:07:13	TheChance	What happened?
2013-02-23 18:07:23	mutes	<TheChance> Dear God I hope I get to the charger before it dies, I need this explanation
2013-02-23 18:07:34	tangentstorm	so there's not that same cost to changing a class as there is to changing a database
2013-02-23 18:07:35	TheChance	Oh. Sorry. Just woke up. I'm cranky. Need coffee.
2013-02-23 18:07:45	tangentstorm	the cost shifts to maintaining the code
2013-02-23 18:07:47	mutes	such a charmed life
2013-02-23 18:07:58	ario	tangentstorm, thanks for the explanation it made some things more clear :)
2013-02-23 18:08:05	tangentstorm	now the question is.. what hapepns if you want to change the policeofficer class?
2013-02-23 18:08:05	mutes	tangentstorm works as he will and TheChance wakes up at 6pm
2013-02-23 18:08:18	TheChance	I'm in college and I learn more in this channel than I do on campus.

2013-02-23 18:08:26	TheChance	All my assignments are online. I go to exams.
2013-02-23 18:08:33	tangentstorm	you want to protect yourself from other classes by not depending on them. just use primitive data as much as possible.

2013-02-23 18:17:56	tangentstorm	the way java works normally, message passing between objects is done as a procedure invocation, but that's not how (i think) you should think of objects

2013-02-23 18:19:21	tangentstorm	but i think lots of problems with objects and concurrent programming go away if you stop thinking of method calls as function/procedure invocations, and start thinking of them as message passing
2013-02-23 18:19:41	tangentstorm	when the officer gives you a ticket, he doesn't get in your car and come home with you
2013-02-23 18:20:06	tangentstorm	he writes his name and badge number on the ticket and moves on to the next car
2013-02-23 18:21:05	tangentstorm	if it were me, i'd probably follow the javabeans guidelines for this ticket class
2013-02-23 18:21:30	tangentstorm	basically: make a constructor that takes no arguments (the blank ticket piece of paper)
2013-02-23 18:21:30	tangentstorm	and have a bunch of getter/setters
2013-02-23 18:21:43	ario	hmm
2013-02-23 18:22:16	tangentstorm	and then on the officer class, probably have a   Ticket makeParkingTicket(Car car) {  ... }
2013-02-23 18:23:00	ario	i can one it's enforce(ParkedCar car, ParkingMeter meter)
2013-02-23 18:23:00	ario	have*
2013-02-23 18:23:51	tangentstorm	ParkedCar seems wrong to me
2013-02-23 18:24:07	tangentstorm	is a parked car a type of car?
2013-02-23 18:24:35	ario	yes
2013-02-23 18:24:44	ario	with make/model/color etc
2013-02-23 18:24:53	ario	minutes parked
2013-02-23 18:24:55	ario	and license
2013-02-23 18:25:32	tangentstorm	i don't believe this
2013-02-23 18:25:45	ario	huh?
2013-02-23 18:25:54	tangentstorm	suppose i show you a picture of a car sitting next to a parking meter, which clearly has expired.
2013-02-23 18:26:00	tangentstorm	how long has the car been there?
2013-02-23 18:26:22	ario	lol
2013-02-23 18:26:27	hg341	that cant be known
2013-02-23 18:26:34	tangentstorm	suppose the meter has 5 minutes left.
2013-02-23 18:26:36	tangentstorm	how long has the car been there?
2013-02-23 18:26:43	tangentstorm	suppose it's a 30-minute meter.
2013-02-23 18:27:06	hg341	anywhere from 0-25 minutes
2013-02-23 18:27:10	tangentstorm	oh?
2013-02-23 18:27:25	tangentstorm	maybe
2013-02-23 18:27:34	tangentstorm	what happens if you put two coins in the meter?
2013-02-23 18:27:38	hg341	assuming they havent reloaded it
2013-02-23 18:27:48	tangentstorm	that too.. they could come bakc
2013-02-23 18:27:50	tangentstorm	back
2013-02-23 18:28:24	tangentstorm	there's no way to inspect a car and see how long it's been parked, unless maybe you have a CSI team or a video camera or something
2013-02-23 18:28:50	ario	well IRL the police officers chalk the tires
2013-02-23 18:29:08	ario	and note it down
2013-02-23 18:29:49	tangentstorm	if the "minutes parked" is part of the assignment, then that's just how it is, but... i wouldn't think of it as being part of the car
2013-02-23 18:30:11	tangentstorm	anyway, suppose you're making a cop game
2013-02-23 18:30:23	hg341	sounds boring
2013-02-23 18:30:27	hg341	make a cop killing game
2013-02-23 18:30:29	tangentstorm	what do you do with the ParkedCar instance when someone gets in it and starts the engine?
2013-02-23 18:31:21	tangentstorm	i mean in java... like how do you turn it from a parked car into a moving car?
2013-02-23 18:32:11	ario	new class?
2013-02-23 18:32:11	tangentstorm	also what if it's a motorcycle?
2013-02-23 18:32:11	ario	:)
2013-02-23 18:32:19	ario	motorcylce get to park on sidewalk!
2013-02-23 18:32:29	tangentstorm	what if it's a horse? :D
2013-02-23 18:33:01	ario	so where do you think getMinutesParked should be in
2013-02-23 18:33:29	tangentstorm	Well, I don't think it should be there at all, personally.
2013-02-23 18:33:57	tangentstorm	But I'd probably just have a Car class.
2013-02-23 18:34:10	tangentstorm	and then I would look only at the parking meter.
2013-02-23 18:34:22	tangentstorm	i would look at isExpired()
2013-02-23 18:35:01	tangentstorm	my guess is the cop doesn't break out a calculator and change the amount of the ticket based on how long he or she thinks you've parked
2013-02-23 18:35:17	tangentstorm	that would be way too complicated, and people would squabble over the number of minutes
2013-02-23 18:35:25	tangentstorm	it's probably a boolean thing.
2013-02-23 18:35:35	hg341	woah you deleted your account?
2013-02-23 18:35:41	tangentstorm	if they come back later and the car is still there, they might put another ticket on the winshield

2013-02-23 18:43:15	ario	if (meter.getMinutesPurchased() ...

2013-02-23 18:45:59	tangentstorm	the meter does that job for the officer.
2013-02-23 18:46:04	tangentstorm	that is it's purpose, right? :D
2013-02-23 18:46:32	tangentstorm	its
2013-02-23 18:46:55	ario	true
2013-02-23 18:46:55	tangentstorm	so let the meter do the work
2013-02-23 18:47:01	ario	ok
2013-02-23 18:48:16	tangentstorm	so maybe something like...      public isExpied() { return this.minutesLeft() <= 0; }

2013-02-23 19:07:15	ario	ok
2013-02-23 19:08:46	tangentstorm	ario: is english your native language?
2013-02-23 19:08:47	ario	no
2013-02-23 19:09:00	ario	but i've been speaking it for a very long time
2013-02-23 19:09:02	ario	i'm sorry
2013-02-23 19:09:32	tangentstorm	nothing to be sorry about :)
2013-02-23 19:09:37	ario	i'm just terrible at expressing what I want to code across
2013-02-23 19:09:51	Senethril	lol
2013-02-23 19:09:55	Senethril	nop
2013-02-23 19:10:37	tangentstorm	i think one causes the other
2013-02-23 19:11:16	tangentstorm	okay, i'm doing the same thing. let me rephrase.
2013-02-23 19:11:58	tangentstorm	I think that you are not putting your ideas into words clearly, and this is what's causing your trouble expressing those ideas in code.
2013-02-23 19:12:38	tangentstorm	You don't have to use English for this, but unfortunately it's the only language I can give you feedback on. :)
2013-02-23 19:13:17	Senethril	one menu one way
2013-02-23 19:13:45	tangentstorm	When I see this:  "class PoliceOfficer { public ParkingTicket ..."  I'm picturing the police officer object emitting a parking ticket object
2013-02-23 19:14:35	ario	i see
2013-02-23 19:14:35	Senethril	:x
2013-02-23 19:14:38	tangentstorm	when i see this:  "isExpired(ParkedCar car, ParkingMeter meter)"  ... i imagine asking a question
2013-02-23 19:15:21	tangentstorm	it is like i am saying...  "Hello, Officer. Here is a parking meter, and here is a parked car. Is something expired?"
2013-02-23 19:15:45	ario	lol
2013-02-23 19:15:46	ario	well...
2013-02-23 19:15:52	tangentstorm	one problem here is that the car has nothing to do with whether or not the meter is expired
2013-02-23 19:16:05	ario	that's kinda how i imagined it
2013-02-23 19:16:06	ario	true
2013-02-23 19:16:06	ario	mm
2013-02-23 19:16:20	tangentstorm	second, i don't have to ask the office anything
2013-02-23 19:16:25	mutes	class Ario_Speedwagon
2013-02-23 19:16:25	tangentstorm	i should be asking the meter
2013-02-23 19:16:26	tangentstorm	"meter, are you expired?"
2013-02-23 19:16:43	Plazma	up yours, nancyboy
2013-02-23 19:16:46	Plazma	is what it would say
2013-02-23 19:16:46	tangentstorm	but then assuming that happens...
2013-02-23 19:17:18	tangentstorm	in your version of the story, i ask the officer and the officer's answer to my yes or no question is what?
2013-02-23 19:17:22	mutes	are you still explaining objects tangentstorm
2013-02-23 19:17:36	ario	you're right tangentstorm
2013-02-23 19:17:50	mutes	answer meeeeee
2013-02-23 19:17:50	tangentstorm	i'm asking you: what is the officer's answer to that yes or no question?
2013-02-23 19:18:44	tangentstorm	in your code
2013-02-23 19:18:44	tangentstorm	class PoliceOfficer { public ParkingTicket isExpired(ParkedCar car, ParkingMeter meter) { ... } }
2013-02-23 19:19:08	tangentstorm	anybody?
2013-02-23 19:19:08	Plazma	mutes: pay attention and you'll see
2013-02-23 19:19:08	ario	uhh
2013-02-23 19:19:08	ario	lol
2013-02-23 19:19:22	ario	his answer is a parkingTicket?
2013-02-23 19:19:37	tangentstorm	yes!
2013-02-23 19:19:37	ario	or nothing
2013-02-23 19:19:38	tangentstorm	no
2013-02-23 19:19:38	tangentstorm	hmm
2013-02-23 19:19:38	ario	null
2013-02-23 19:19:38	tangentstorm	yeah ok, could be null. good point.
2013-02-23 19:20:08	tangentstorm	bad-ass cops like that don't stay parking attendents.
2013-02-23 19:20:08	ario	so it's ot really isExpired
2013-02-23 19:20:08	ario	but inspect()
2013-02-23 19:20:22	tangentstorm	now you're talking
2013-02-23 19:20:23	mutes	plazma, i need to know the question to understand the answer
2013-02-23 19:20:23	mutes	this isnt jeopardy
2013-02-23 19:20:38	Plazma	h's explaining objects
2013-02-23 19:21:08	tangentstorm	i don't know what i'm explaining, other than parking meters :D
2013-02-23 19:21:08	ario	ahaha
2013-02-23 19:21:10	mutes	so what is arios question
2013-02-23 19:21:22	Plazma	i object
2013-02-23 19:21:39	Plazma	to objects
2013-02-23 19:21:39	mutes	ario
2013-02-23 19:22:02	ario	my question want do i need a getMinutesPark
2013-02-23 19:22:02	ario	and getMinutesPurchased()
2013-02-23 19:22:09	ario	and we ended up here
2013-02-23 19:22:33	ario	:)
2013-02-23 19:23:18	mutes	i dont see why not
2013-02-23 19:23:18	ario	was*
2013-02-23 19:23:18	Plazma	mission accomplished
2013-02-23 19:23:18	ario	but tangentstorm made things more clear
2013-02-23 19:23:18	tangentstorm	i wasn't answering the question, i was just responding to the way he asked it
2013-02-23 19:23:18	ario	^
2013-02-23 19:23:18	mutes	but who was phone?
2013-02-23 19:23:27	mutes	dont answer that ario
2013-02-23 19:23:40	tangentstorm	i didn't understand that question either :D
2013-02-23 19:24:03	mutes	precisely
2013-02-23 19:24:14	mutes	queue 200 lines answering it
2013-02-23 19:24:14	mutes	:P
2013-02-23 19:25:29	tangentstorm	okay, so ario: i don't know the answer to your question. you have to imagine a parking meter and how you think it works.
2013-02-23 19:26:27	tangentstorm	does it matter how many minutes were purchased? or do you just put a coin in and the clock runs for a fixed amount of time?
2013-02-23 19:27:20	tangentstorm	like... what does it mean to say some number of minutes were purchased?
2013-02-23 19:27:32	hg341	well parking meters are starting to take credit cards now
2013-02-23 19:27:35	tangentstorm	make it a complete sentence:   __________ purchased <n> minutes.
2013-02-23 19:27:45	ario	you just purchase x about of minutes
2013-02-23 19:28:19	tangentstorm	Who does?
2013-02-23 19:28:28	ario	the parkedCar?
2013-02-23 19:29:15	tangentstorm	you know that is not true in real life :D
2013-02-23 19:29:15	tangentstorm	not yet anyway. maybe someday we'll have smart cars and bluetooth parking meters and it'll all work out.
2013-02-23 19:29:15	ario	well yeah, also the parking meter does not exceed the time - it just specifies it's expired
2013-02-23 19:29:22	ario	but in this case we are suppose to record the amount of time exceeded
2013-02-23 19:30:00	tangentstorm	okay, so *that* is something a parking meter can know
2013-02-23 19:30:16	ario	yeah first i can isExpired as a boolean
2013-02-23 19:30:41	ario	which was a mistake. now i have to account for exceeded time
2013-02-23 19:30:42	ario	i had*
2013-02-23 19:31:17	ario	btw my english isn't bad i just type wrong words a lot when i'm typing fast lol
2013-02-23 19:31:18	tangentstorm	so slow down

2013-02-23 19:31:39	tangentstorm	imagine: here is a car. here is a meter.
2013-02-23 19:31:48	tangentstorm	a man gets out of the car, and puts $1 on the meter.
2013-02-23 19:31:56	tangentstorm	he goes away. he comes back.

2013-02-23 19:32:17	tangentstorm	there is still 20 minutes on the meter.
2013-02-23 19:32:17	tangentstorm	another car pulls into the parking spot.
2013-02-23 19:32:42	tangentstorm	a lady gets out. she sees the meter has 20 minutes.
2013-02-23 19:32:43	tangentstorm	she goes into the store.
2013-02-23 19:32:43	tangentstorm	she comes out 30 minutes later.
2013-02-23 19:32:44	tangentstorm	there is a cop in front of her car, looking at the meter.
2013-02-23 19:33:21	tangentstorm	does the cop care how many minutes were purchased? does the meter care?
2013-02-23 19:33:23	ario	omg
2013-02-23 19:33:38	ario	now youre making it super complicated :)
2013-02-23 19:33:38	tangentstorm	remember, the minutes were purchased by a man who left a long time ago.
2013-02-23 19:33:53	ario	i love it
2013-02-23 19:33:54	tangentstorm	the cop doesn't even know about the man.
2013-02-23 19:34:07	ario	but it's too much for my programming knowledge to be able to code such a thing
2013-02-23 19:34:15	tangentstorm	so like i said, forget about objects, just imagine you're the cop. what is it you actually NEED to know about the situation?

2013-02-24 12:36:49	tangentstorm	hi ertfgfd
2013-02-24 12:37:00	ertfgfd	Im wondering if anyone could help me with f#
2013-02-24 12:37:09	tangentstorm	just ask your question
2013-02-24 12:37:10	ertfgfd	Been trying to figure something out for ages T_T
2013-02-24 12:38:08	ertfgfd	Ive used 2 functions using list.filter to get 2 integers however i need to join them together into their own list, Ive tried using zip but i keep getting the error "This expression was expected to have type     'a list     but here has type     int    "
2013-02-24 12:39:38	tangentstorm	i don't know f# but in most functional languages you would take an empty list and prepend the other items to it
2013-02-24 12:39:44	tangentstorm	like a : b : []
2013-02-24 12:39:50	tangentstorm	where : is the prepend operator
2013-02-24 12:40:11	tangentstorm	also called cons in some languages, like lisp
2013-02-24 12:40:19	ertfgfd	ahh ill try that out
2013-02-24 12:41:50	ertfgfd	I hate this language t_T
2013-02-24 12:42:40	tangentstorm	what lead you to try it?
2013-02-24 12:44:12	tangentstorm	Amadiro: you have a good point. I'm not sure what to do about it though. :/
2013-02-24 12:44:38	Amadiro	tangentstorm, when in doubt, draw a {tree,mindmap,graph,pseudoalgorithm,comic}
2013-02-24 12:44:53	tangentstorm	:) that's actually what i did!
2013-02-24 12:45:01	tangentstorm	i went off and worked on paper for a while
2013-02-24 12:45:36	Amadiro	I'd recommend starting to think about what platforms you want to support and what libraries you want to use
2013-02-24 12:45:57	Amadiro	and what capabilities you want to have, like hardware-accelerated semi-transparent textures on multiple layers etc
2013-02-24 12:46:05	tangentstorm	me? i want to support a virtual machine running inside a browser
2013-02-24 12:46:11	Amadiro	that'll very quickly narrow down what frameworks/libraries/APIs you have to use
2013-02-24 12:47:13	tangentstorm	the game itself isn't really that much more difficult from minesweeper or tetris
2013-02-24 12:47:27	tangentstorm	it's just a little puzzle game
2013-02-24 12:48:14	Amadiro	well, that makes things very simple, but chosing the libraries/technology to use much more open
2013-02-24 12:48:16	tangentstorm	what's complicating it is that i'm trying to present how to build it

2013-02-24 12:49:31	tangentstorm	then i'm going to pass that to d3.js to draw the scene
2013-02-24 12:50:31	tangentstorm	i guess my problems really don't have anything to do with the game :)
2013-02-24 12:52:03	tangentstorm	the problem is that i'm trying to present the source code to readers so they can see how the game is built, step by step

2013-02-24 15:36:14	Giraficy	heads is int, it's declared in dog.cpp (same file where the problem was)
2013-02-24 15:37:49	Giraficy	but i researched this problem, and it seems that also other functions have this same problem
2013-02-24 15:38:20	Giraficy	only some functions manage to call die(), even though they all seem to be same

2013-02-24 15:45:58	@chance	less verbose
2013-02-24 15:46:10	@chance	not 'better', but most people understand them
2013-02-24 15:46:25	@chance	heads += 1 is the same as heads = heads + 1
2013-02-24 15:46:38	@chance	and even more on that
2013-02-24 15:46:41	@chance	so is heads++
2013-02-24 15:48:29	tangentstorm	yeah, what chance said, Giraficy ... it's really just a style thing.
2013-02-24 15:48:37	Giraficy	okay

2013-02-24 16:29:03	calculatingexist	but to answer your question
2013-02-24 16:29:16	calculatingexist	yes i am talking about what is currently known as the "big bang"
2013-02-24 16:30:27	calculatingexist	what i call what i'm talking about is very non-buzzword and specific an accurate - I call it the first thing to exist and at least some of the things that came after it
2013-02-24 16:30:43	tangentstorm	yeah i'm not going to email you, but i'd be happy to help you learn how to record a conversation in IRC. most IRC clients do have logging tools :)
2013-02-24 16:31:51	tangentstorm	what is it you want to program?
2013-02-24 16:32:05	calculatingexist	a 2D visual computer simulation
2013-02-24 16:32:17	tangentstorm	just the thing you described in that post?
2013-02-24 16:32:20	calculatingexist	Yes
2013-02-24 16:35:17	tangentstorm	your hunch in your post is accurate: this is very hard to understand and follow

2013-02-24 16:35:40	tangentstorm	but: what you want to visualize is not hard to program, and i am willing to help you if you put in some effort.
2013-02-24 16:35:41	calculatingexist	or final proof
2013-02-24 16:36:00	calculatingexist	ok what kind of effort do i need to put in?
2013-02-24 16:36:10	calculatingexist	Thanks btw.
2013-02-24 16:36:19	tangentstorm	there is a tool called "processing" which is specifically designed for new programmers

2013-02-24 16:36:49	tangentstorm	can i assume you've never done any programming at all?
2013-02-24 16:36:56	calculatingexist	Very little in java.

2013-02-24 16:37:09	tangentstorm	oh, well that's acutally good. processing is a dialect of java.
2013-02-24 16:37:23	mutes	is this a distributed prallel god proof
2013-02-24 16:37:39	mutes	s/prallel/parallel/
2013-02-24 16:37:40	tangentstorm	i have no idea what it is :)
2013-02-24 16:39:48	tangentstorm	calculatingexist: anyway, go to http://processing.org/ , download and install it, and write a script to draw the first two circles.
2013-02-24 16:39:59	tangentstorm	if you can do that much, i'll help you with the rest.
2013-02-24 16:40:32	tangentstorm	if that's completely overwhelming, i have recorded some videos at http://gamesketchlib.org/ that walk through using processing from the very start
2013-02-24 16:40:42	tangentstorm	they are aimed at people who have never coded anything before.
2013-02-24 16:40:52	calculatingexist	ok
2013-02-24 16:42:32	tangentstorm	also: this has nothing whatosoever to do with graphics, but you might be interested in this: http://isabelle.in.tum.de/Isar/
2013-02-24 16:43:02	tangentstorm	It's a language for writing formal proofs, with tools to help you formalize your ideas.
2013-02-24 16:43:14	calculatingexist	are you perhaps willing to establish some kind of backup plan should either of us have to go?
2013-02-24 16:43:27	calculatingexist	like e-mail :)

2013-02-24 16:49:01	mutes	i think ion-tom has learned some programming now, but if i could find his site...
2013-02-24 16:49:19	Amadiro	tangentstorm, no link, it's a local thing. An arcade, basically.
2013-02-24 16:49:28	Amadiro	we only run student-made indie games
2013-02-24 16:49:33	Amadiro	and all the profit goes to the students
2013-02-24 16:49:37	mutes	it's a very romantic idea  for people who love SM's Civilization
2013-02-24 16:49:51	mutes	which i totally do
2013-02-24 16:49:56	mutes	Amadiro, that's cool
2013-02-24 16:50:08	mutes	they put them in cabinets and get the quarters?
2013-02-24 16:50:19	tangentstorm	oh wow. that's awesome :)
2013-02-24 16:50:19	Amadiro	yeah, its pretty popular... I don't have the current numbers right now, but I think the most popular games has been played like 50k times now.
2013-02-24 16:50:35	mutes	and you dont have any sort of link?
2013-02-24 16:50:35	tangentstorm	Amadiro: where are you in the world?
2013-02-24 16:50:38	Amadiro	mutes, no, I've built and provide the machines, they just submit the games to me and I put them on there
2013-02-24 16:50:40	Amadiro	tangentstorm, oslo, norway
2013-02-24 16:51:04	Amadiro	mutes, none in english. One second, I'll find some images for you
2013-02-24 16:51:19	tangentstorm	Huh. That's pretty awesome. :) Are you a member of the IGDA?
2013-02-24 16:51:36	Amadiro	no, no clue what they do
2013-02-24 16:51:49	tangentstorm	international game developers association.
2013-02-24 16:52:10	mutes	i want to copy this idea D:
2013-02-24 16:52:20	mutes	the last arcade near me just died
2013-02-24 16:52:31	Amadiro	mutes, http://imgur.com/a/sLgMQ#0 that is the first machine I built. Images from the drawing board up to the finished thing
2013-02-24 16:52:33	tangentstorm	i'm not part of it but i have a friend who is on the board of the seattle chapter.
2013-02-24 16:52:48	mutes	america might be too pop culture corporatized to appreciate that sort of thing though
2013-02-24 16:53:12	Amadiro	tangentstorm, I guessed as much, but I still don't know what they do in particular. My platform is probably too small to be of interest anyway, we have like 14 developers or so.
2013-02-24 16:54:34	mutes	i have really got to install arch
2013-02-24 16:54:43	mutes	i feel like i will finally be 'legit' once i do :P
2013-02-24 16:54:59	mutes	well, maybe semi legit, before installing slack and building LFS
2013-02-24 16:55:01	Amadiro	installing arch used to be a matter of pressing the enter key like 10 times
2013-02-24 16:55:06	Amadiro	but now they dumped the installer for some reason
2013-02-24 16:55:23	mutes	everyone says 'ULTIMATE CUSTOMIZABILITY'
2013-02-24 16:55:30	mutes	and thats always good
2013-02-24 16:55:47	Amadiro	well... its fairly customizable, but I guess gentoo offers you even more in that respect
2013-02-24 16:55:47	mutes	too bad i only barely understand the filesystem
2013-02-24 16:56:11	Amadiro	the arcade machine can run any number of platforms, btw -- there is an automated 4-way KVM switch in there that can automatically switch to the machine that runs the game
2013-02-24 16:56:26	Amadiro	currently we have a linux PC, a windows PC and a raspberry pi in there, but integrating, say, an xbox or android device wouldn't be hard either
2013-02-24 16:56:52	Amadiro	people just give me their game and I get to run it however -- linux ideally, wine is the second option, the windows box the third
2013-02-24 16:57:12	mutes	what is a hackerspace
2013-02-24 16:57:12	Amadiro	a place where people go to... hack
2013-02-24 16:57:12	mutes	and why do i know my uni wont have one :(
2013-02-24 16:57:22	mojoey	because legal beagles
2013-02-24 16:57:40	Amadiro	each game gets its own user-account and such, so it's all encapsulated fairly neatly, nobody can tip on other peoples toes, and stray processes can be cleaned up.
2013-02-24 16:57:51	tangentstorm	Amadiro: cool gallery :)
2013-02-24 16:57:58	mutes	very cool
2013-02-24 16:58:02	mojoey	^
2013-02-24 16:58:50	Amadiro	We'll also be at TG (the gathering) in a month, btw, if anyone is there
2013-02-24 16:59:00	tangentstorm	Amadiro: you could kickstart the heck out of this.
2013-02-24 16:59:00	Amadiro	We'll bring at least one machine for people to play on for free
2013-02-24 16:59:05	Amadiro	I'll also be holding a few talks
2013-02-24 16:59:24	Amadiro	tangentstorm, meh, the whole thing set me back like 200 bucks or so. My university sponsored the gaming hardware inside.
2013-02-24 17:00:29	mojoey	where did/do you go to school?
2013-02-24 17:00:37	Amadiro	university of oslo
2013-02-24 17:00:41	mojoey	nice
2013-02-24 17:00:48	Amadiro	dpt. of mathematics (but this got sponsored by the dept. of informatics)
2013-02-24 17:01:34	mojoey	were they happy that you made an arcade cabinet, or were they aware of what they were funding?
2013-02-24 17:01:42	tangentstorm	Amadiro: yeah, but you brought a wide range of skills together to make that... i would imagine quite a few people would love to know how to set this up in their neighborhood
2013-02-24 17:02:52	calculatingexist	I've watched over 10 minutes of the video "sketchbots, part 1.2" and it doesn't teach me how to draw circles
2013-02-24 17:03:03	calculatingexist	will it teach me soon or is there somewhere else I should try to learn?
2013-02-24 17:03:07	calculatingexist	Just asking.
2013-02-24 17:03:09	Amadiro	mojoey, heh, yeah, I told them. They were pretty positive about it, and I can basically get them to pay whatever hardware for me I need, and put the machines whereever on campus I want.
2013-02-24 17:03:19	mojoey	brb
2013-02-24 17:03:28	mojoey	moving to Oslo
2013-02-24 17:03:28	tangentstorm	calculatingexist: you just type circle() instead of rect()... the videos are about how to program and look things up
2013-02-24 17:03:56	Amadiro	tangentstorm, there's some obvious building skills required, but other than that, the biggest challenge is pretty much to whip all those ill-behaved applications written by like 8 different teams into shape to work together without clogging up the system
2013-02-24 17:04:20	mojoey	I've been looking at UC Berekeley, since the in-state tuition is the cheapest anywhere
2013-02-24 17:04:31	Amadiro	which brings me back to processing being the worst offender in that regard -- it never shuts down cleanly and I had to hack around with xorg to make it work in the arcade setting
2013-02-24 17:04:44	tangentstorm	Amadiro: but also business skills, community outreach, project management... you could totally franchise this
2013-02-24 17:04:52	mojoey	and the 'prestige' from putting such a school on my resume
2013-02-24 17:05:35	Amadiro	tangentstorm, I guess, but I'm not really that interested. Once I leave the university (whenever) I'm planning to just make all the games free-to-play and leave the machines standing around un-updated indefinitely for people to enjoy, unless there is someone willing to take the project over.
2013-02-24 17:06:03	tangentstorm	what do you want to do after uni?
2013-02-24 17:06:22	Amadiro	No clue -- in fact, I may stay there in the foreseeable future, I just got a job at the uni
2013-02-24 17:07:36	tangentstorm	fun :)
2013-02-24 17:08:05	Amadiro	Another thing I've been thinking about is to open a general (indie) game-dev "centre" at the university or in cooperation with one of the local hackerspaces in oslo
2013-02-24 17:08:25	Amadiro	(there are quite a few other hackerspaces as well in oslo, some would probably be willing to sponsor something like that)
2013-02-24 17:08:35	Amadiro	would be nice to have a place for people who are interested in game design to go to
2013-02-24 17:09:01	tangentstorm	yeah, no kidding
2013-02-24 17:09:01	Amadiro	and exchange with people who already have a game or two on steam or desura or so
2013-02-24 17:10:31	Amadiro	oh, by the way, if anyone was wondering, those joysticks just register as USB keyboards
2013-02-24 17:10:57	Amadiro	the left one maps to WASD and RTFG & spacebar for the buttons, the right one to the arrow keys, OPKL and enter
2013-02-24 17:11:07	Amadiro	that makes it very easy to handle them without any libraries
2013-02-24 17:11:11	tangentstorm	:)
2013-02-24 17:11:42	calculatingexist	Sorry tangentstorm but I'm having trouble gaining confidence that this is the right way for me to do what I'm trying to do. Tell me please, if I could show you the truth and importance of what I'm trying to do, would you be interested in programming it for me ?
2013-02-24 17:11:42	Amadiro	also, each player has their own usb unit, so one player pressing too many buttons can't clog up the other players inputs
2013-02-24 17:11:42	Amadiro	(usb supports reporting up to 6 button presses simultaneously)
2013-02-24 17:11:51	mojoey	calculatingexist: *what* are you trying to do?
2013-02-24 17:13:14	calculatingexist	What i'm trying to do has benefit not just for me, but for everyone else - which is precisely why I feel ok in asking others to program it for me that already have the knowledge of programming, something i don't have
2013-02-24 17:13:14	tangentstorm	calculatingexist: i have my own projects, sorry
2013-02-24 17:13:14	mojoey	...then why not learn programming?
2013-02-24 17:13:14	calculatingexist	mojoey I'm trying to create a 2D computer simulation of the first thing to exist and at least some of the things that came after it
2013-02-24 17:13:14	calculatingexist	http://redd.it/19541j has more info

2013-02-24 17:13:14	calculatingexist	I could learn programming, you're right mojoey, but would it not be better if someone who already knows how to program does it?
2013-02-24 17:13:14	mojoey	not really
2013-02-24 17:13:22	mojoey	its a life skill
2013-02-24 17:13:42	tangentstorm	calculatingexist: i agree. especially when you are trying to show the world something it's never seen before.
2013-02-24 17:13:54	tangentstorm	i agree with mojoey i mean :)
2013-02-24 17:14:09	Amadiro	calculating the intersection of circles is ultra-simple
2013-02-24 17:14:29	Amadiro	you'll be able to implement your simulation of whatever in no time
2013-02-24 17:15:12	tangentstorm	calculatingexist: you have obviously spent a huge amount of time on your proof, but the burden is still on you to make it understandable to other people
2013-02-24 17:15:12	mojoey	^
2013-02-24 17:15:30	mojoey	so basically what he wants is a 2D version of Spore?
2013-02-24 17:16:54	tangentstorm	i've been sitting on a bunch of cool ideas myself that right now only make sense to me... If I showed people my notes I'd look like I was nuts, and probably be dismissed as a crackpot. :/
2013-02-24 17:17:32	mojoey	welcome to /r/conspiracy :P
2013-02-24 17:19:09	calculatingexist	Ok.
2013-02-24 17:19:09	calculatingexist	Tell me this though, say I program the simulation myself.
2013-02-24 17:19:11	calculatingexist	Then what?
2013-02-24 17:19:34	Amadiro	then what what
2013-02-24 17:19:34	calculatingexist	My computer isn't nearly fast enough to render a proton.
2013-02-24 17:19:34	mojoey	Then you post it to reddit
2013-02-24 17:19:34	mutes	then...it's programmed
2013-02-24 17:19:34	tangentstorm	The problem with exploring new territory is there's no way to tell if you're crazy or a genius :D... I have definitely had a few days over the past year when I started worrying I was going to end up like John Nash (the "beautiful mind" guy, who was both)
2013-02-24 17:19:34	Amadiro	you have achieved your goal
2013-02-24 17:19:34	mojoey	reap the karma
2013-02-24 17:19:34	calculatingexist	I would have to get a supercomputer to do the computing
2013-02-24 17:19:54	mutes	please dont trying to crowdsource
2013-02-24 17:19:56	mojoey	if its 2D?
2013-02-24 17:20:12	mojoey	pfft
2013-02-24 17:20:13	Amadiro	calculatingexist, why do you think a supercomputer would run your simulation faster than your computer
2013-02-24 17:20:13	mojoey	all it needs is x-y physics
2013-02-24 17:20:14	mojoey	not too stressing on the CPU
2013-02-24 17:20:20	mutes	he's trying to sim the universe mojoey
2013-02-24 17:20:22	mojoey	oh
2013-02-24 17:20:41	mojoey	he said 2D physics
2013-02-24 17:21:06	calculatingexist	Nevermind.
2013-02-24 17:21:06	calculatingexist	Thank you for your time.

2013-02-24 17:25:29	Amadiro	I'm just now reading through the guys description more closely
2013-02-24 17:25:42	Amadiro	its actually totally hilarious
2013-02-24 17:26:02	tangentstorm	it mean something to him, though.
2013-02-24 17:26:05	Amadiro	1 Create two points distance x apart 2 Create a circle of radius x from each of the two points 3 Analyze where the circles intersect
2013-02-24 17:26:58	Amadiro	Create circles of radius x from each of the points where the circles intersect
2013-02-24 17:26:58	Amadiro	like that's ever going to give you anything interesting
2013-02-24 17:27:05	mojoey	you never know
2013-02-24 17:27:09	Amadiro	sure I know
2013-02-24 17:27:43	Amadiro	just draw it out and you'll see
2013-02-24 17:27:43	mojoey	ok...not the smartest line
2013-02-24 17:27:43	Amadiro	or use geogebra

2013-02-24 17:31:13	Amadiro	regardless the chosen starting configuration
2013-02-24 17:31:45	tangentstorm	it's probably also not an accurate description of what he wants
2013-02-24 17:32:13	Amadiro	"It is very hard to understand I bet" lol
2013-02-24 17:32:44	Amadiro	you don't even need to calculate this, you can just write down an algebraic expression that is exact
2013-02-24 17:32:48	Amadiro	writing a computer program for that is a bit of a waste of time
2013-02-24 17:32:58	mojoey	its good practice

2013-02-24 17:34:34	Amadiro	mojoey, the problem with implementing mathematical/simulation/physical/geometrical problems is that you tend to end up fooling yourself into thinking the problem is more complicated than it is
2013-02-24 17:34:48	mojoey	thats true
2013-02-24 17:35:12	tangentstorm	Also you can be tricked by your drawing into making assumptions that aren't true in the general case.
2013-02-24 17:35:52	Amadiro	like in this case you may use an approximative formula that would give complicated results just because it is imprecise, even though the actual mathematical formula for the problem is something easy like {((-1)^i)*a, ((-1)^(i+1))*a} or so

2013-02-24 17:52:59	Amadiro	I believe doing nonblocking i/o on stdout/stdin is not portable for windows
2013-02-24 17:52:59	Amadiro	so you have to use a thread there
2013-02-24 17:53:29	Amadiro	That's assuming you care about windows

2013-02-24 17:55:54	Amadiro	or an interface that uses i/o in general and expects "user-input"
2013-02-24 17:56:04	tangentstorm	ohh...
2013-02-24 17:56:15	tangentstorm	you were talking about the raw_input() line
2013-02-24 17:57:14	tangentstorm	i should really wrap crt.pas for python... it handles all this stuff.

2013-02-24 22:37:09	@chance	what if you tracked what iteration in the loop your in
2013-02-24 22:38:07	jdogdan	How would I do that?
2013-02-24 22:39:19	@chance	well right now your printing a value, what if you had a counter variable which started at 0, and you added one everytime the loop goes through
2013-02-24 22:43:57	jdogdan	Is there a built in method that lets me find what position a value in the array is so I can multiply by that number by the array postion?
2013-02-24 22:44:38	@chance	well you do know what position your at if you increment a counter :)
2013-02-24 22:45:38	ElectricSheep	what language is this?
2013-02-24 22:46:03	@chance	ruby
2013-02-24 22:47:22	ElectricSheep	Just thought I'd ask
2013-02-24 22:47:42	jdogdan	man I suck at this lol
2013-02-24 22:48:55	ElectricSheep	Well, there is index(obj) -> int
2013-02-24 22:49:41	amigojapan	jdogdan: just add something like counter=counter+1   inside the loop, and print the counter too I guess
2013-02-24 22:51:16	amigojapan	jdogdan: counter will be the position in the arra
2013-02-24 22:52:39	jdogdan	Could you show me what the method might look like if you tried it?
2013-02-24 22:53:00	amigojapan	jdogdan: then so something like sum=counter*stooge.number      I need to see what code you have up to now, and I dont know ruby
2013-02-24 22:53:22	amigojapan	jdogdan: I could write it in another langauge
2013-02-24 22:53:47	jdogdan	python?
2013-02-24 22:53:49	ElectricSheep	Well, if you had an array a = [ "a", "b", "c" ]
2013-02-24 22:54:00	ElectricSheep	Then a.index("c") would return 2
2013-02-24 22:54:18	amigojapan	jdogdan: sure, python, why not,  give me a minute
2013-02-24 22:55:23	@chance	sum, i = 0, 0; for item in list: sum+= i*item; i+= 1
2013-02-24 22:55:27	@chance	or better:
2013-02-24 22:56:32	@chance	sum(i*item for i, item in enumerate(list))
2013-02-24 22:58:09	@chance	ruby probably has an enumerate :)

2013-02-24 23:30:53	amigojapan	chance: well, using a variable would be just as good,  what you found is just some more syntax sugar
2013-02-24 23:31:08	amigojapan	specific to ruby
2013-02-24 23:31:18	@chance	yeah, i was looking to the equivlent of what id write in python
2013-02-24 23:31:28	@chance	which is a generator expression
2013-02-24 23:32:36	amigojapan	I see chance
2013-02-24 23:33:06	amigojapan	my python is not very pythonic... I dont like to use language specific stuff, if makes it harder to port to another langauge when needed
2013-02-24 23:34:02	@chance	i suppose. most 'language specific' stuff is easy to read, and is there purely for design/style
2013-02-24 23:34:09	@chance	which might make porting it easier
2013-02-24 23:35:34	amigojapan	chance: no, it is better to remain loyal to C style, which is usually usable in other langauges, and thus easier to port
2013-02-24 23:36:05	@chance	i feel differently, but thats mean.
2013-02-24 23:36:08	@chance	me*
2013-02-24 23:36:14	amigojapan	chance: often you dont need to change anything when you use C style. just a few bits
2013-02-24 23:36:21	amigojapan	ok
2013-02-24 23:36:46	@chance	if your writing python, you should be writing python, not writing a program as C in Python
2013-02-24 23:36:58	amigojapan	chance: I have proted a program from python to JS...  since I had written it in C style, it was ratehr easy to port
2013-02-24 23:37:12	amigojapan	chance: that is a matter of opinion
2013-02-24 23:37:21	@chance	i dont think it makes a big difference for porting
2013-02-24 23:37:54	@chance	not to mention, the majority of application code doesnt port well for other reasons, like library uses, every library is vastly different, especially language to language.
2013-02-24 23:38:50	amigojapan	yeah, libraries vary from langauge to langauge

2013-02-24 23:59:48	amigojapan	bolcselo: yeah, I think that is valid
2013-02-25 00:00:08	bolcselo	doesnt seem to be
2013-02-25 00:00:27	bolcselo	only takes declarations when i do it

2013-02-25 00:01:43	amigojapan	bolcselo: that should be totally valid
2013-02-25 00:02:06	bolcselo	are you coming from java or c amigojapan
2013-02-25 00:02:08	amigojapan	bolcselo: can you pastebin the code? and include the exact error and line number?

2013-02-25 00:02:28	amigojapan	bolcselo: I am guessing your program is Java from what I see, or C#

2013-02-25 00:02:38	amigojapan	ok
2013-02-25 00:02:52	amigojapan	still, it should be valid

2013-02-25 00:09:09	newbieatcoding	hmmm
2013-02-25 00:09:12	newbieatcoding	like a year ago

2013-02-25 00:09:47	newbieatcoding	and i want to learn c/c++ what not
2013-02-25 00:09:54	bolcselo	need a resource newbie, or have a specific problem?
2013-02-25 00:09:54	newbieatcoding	but i'm not really sure what program to like use
2013-02-25 00:10:00	newbieatcoding	like i used eclipse for java
2013-02-25 00:10:01	Z_Mass	bolcselo: Are you writting your classes all in the header? It not, try setting variable = 3 inside of B's constructor: B::B() : variable(3) {}
2013-02-25 00:10:18	newbieatcoding	could i use eclipse for c stuff too?
2013-02-25 00:10:22	bolcselo	i dont...think so
2013-02-25 00:10:33	Z_Mass	Eclipse has CDT, I wouldn't recommend it though
2013-02-25 00:11:02	newbieatcoding	is there something you would recommend though?
2013-02-25 00:11:02	newbieatcoding	or some website i can practice with
2013-02-25 00:11:03	bolcselo	Z_Mass, yeah, that works, it just kills my golf score
2013-02-25 00:11:34	bolcselo	so i was wondering if you could do it ouside member functions like constructors
2013-02-25 00:11:46	Z_Mass	newbieatcoding: I would take a look at Codelite
2013-02-25 00:12:13	newbieatcoding	ahh alright thank you
2013-02-25 00:12:14	amigojapan	bolcselo: this compiles http://ideone.com/oqksfO   it seems you just need to change the variable in the constructor

2013-02-25 00:13:16	amigojapan	bolcselo: I was able to change the value of variable
2013-02-25 00:13:43	bolcselo	i guess im saying i dont want to use the constructor because then i have to 'waste lines' on lots of constructors for a few child classes
2013-02-25 00:14:03	bolcselo	ie: not useing methods
2013-02-25 00:14:06	amigojapan	bolcselo: ok, tehn I guess hte answer is, you cant withought a constructor
2013-02-25 00:14:12	bolcselo	but i guess thats not possible
2013-02-25 00:14:18	Z_Mass	You can make it static
2013-02-25 00:15:33	bolcselo	but each child class has different values :/
2013-02-25 00:15:50	Z_Mass	Then what's wrong with a constructor? It's there to set up the class
2013-02-25 00:16:18	bolcselo	i guess ill just write separate constructors until im allowed to use cpp11
2013-02-25 00:16:30	bolcselo	nothing is 'wrong' with it, it's just not elegant and hurts my score
2013-02-25 00:16:43	amigojapan	score?

2013-02-25 00:17:06	Z_Mass	It's the proper way though. The class shoudl be ready to use after the constructor is called.
2013-02-25 00:17:21	amigojapan	bolcselo: make a  macro that builds constructors then, I guess, you hsould be able to reduce the ammound of code
2013-02-25 00:17:23	Z_Mass	I'm not sure what C++11 would offer extra in that regard

2013-02-25 00:19:08	bolcselo	yeah amigojapan, not sure i could call it properly though
2013-02-25 00:19:11	bolcselo	thats an idea though
2013-02-25 00:19:33	Z_Mass	I'm not sure I follow. A's constructor is going to be called when B is created anyways.
2013-02-25 00:19:33	bolcselo	it's just a community thing, not really a corporate thing
2013-02-25 00:20:38	amigojapan	Z_Mass: it is. because B inherits from A
2013-02-25 00:21:20	bolcselo	assuming A has anything besides a default one, no it wont
2013-02-25 00:21:36	bolcselo	constructors arent inherited
2013-02-25 00:22:06	Z_Mass	Well if it doesn't define a default constructor, you would have to explicitly call it: B::B() : A(some, vars) {}
2013-02-25 00:22:51	Z_Mass	I just looked up C++11 constructor inheritance, it's just short form basically. Like amigojapan said, A() has to be called if B inherits from A.
2013-02-25 00:24:10	bolcselo	hmm
2013-02-25 00:24:12	bolcselo	you mean overload it?
2013-02-25 00:24:23	Z_Mass	No
2013-02-25 00:24:42	amigojapan	I think constructors are inherited, except when you override them in child classes
2013-02-25 00:25:40	Z_Mass	If you don't define a default constructor for A, meaning it must be passed some variables, then B will have to pass those variables to A.
2013-02-25 00:25:55	Z_Mass	Even if B only has a default constructor
2013-02-25 00:25:55	bolcselo	oh yes it will
2013-02-25 00:25:59	bolcselo	or rather, it 'CAN!'
2013-02-25 00:26:04	bolcselo	thats nifty
2013-02-25 00:27:17	bolcselo	i guess i can make a 'modular' constructor in the base then, and feed it stuff in the class construction
2013-02-25 00:27:44	bolcselo	child class construction""
2013-02-25 00:28:05	bolcselo	reduces my lines by a quarter in that regard, thanks guys
2013-02-25 00:28:46	amigojapan	no problem
2013-02-25 00:28:54	Z_Mass	Np :)
2013-02-25 00:37:49	Nocturned_	Anyone here able to help a scrub out with a hopefully simple problem?
2013-02-25 00:54:59	bolcselo	line 46 needs to be else if Nocturned_

2013-02-25 01:20:44	Kelet	fgetc returns an integer
2013-02-25 01:21:42	Kelet	If you need arg.text is a char * and not a char, you can just do arg.text[index] = fgetc(in) where index might be 0
2013-02-25 01:24:24	ramrod	i see
2013-02-25 01:24:54	ramrod	so i need to make a for loop for the index
2013-02-25 01:25:28	ramrod	int i = 0; i < ???; i++
2013-02-25 01:25:28	ramrod	if i use sizeof, wont it just return the size of a pointer
2013-02-25 01:25:28	ramrod	how do i deal with that?
2013-02-25 01:25:52	Kelet	sizeof(arg.text) / sizeof(char *)
2013-02-25 01:25:57	Kelet	i think
2013-02-25 01:26:13	Kelet	sizeof(arg.text) will be 10 * sizeof(char *) if you have 10 elements
2013-02-25 01:26:14	Kelet	that are char *
2013-02-25 01:26:35	Kelet	if they are just chars
2013-02-25 01:26:35	Kelet	sizeof(arg.text) / sizeof(char)
2013-02-25 01:29:28	ramrod	i guess it would just be easier to make arg.text an array

2013-02-25 12:01:03	tangentstorm	did you get a c++ project set up?
2013-02-25 12:01:10	Giraficy	yes
2013-02-25 12:01:17	tangentstorm	there's really not much to it
2013-02-25 12:02:02	tangentstorm	if you look where the line numbers are, you can click just to the right of them and you'll see a red octagon appear
2013-02-25 12:02:28	tangentstorm	the line numbers on the left of the edit area
2013-02-25 12:02:30	Giraficy	what does it stand for?

2013-02-25 12:03:13	tangentstorm	in america, red octagons are stop signs (traffic signs)
2013-02-25 12:03:15	Giraficy	oh
2013-02-25 12:03:21	tangentstorm	put one on line 7 and 13
2013-02-25 12:03:40	Giraficy	they are in finland too, just didn't know what they meant in c::b
2013-02-25 12:03:55	tangentstorm	then do debug -> start  (looks like it's f8 by default)
2013-02-25 12:04:29	tangentstorm	it should say hello world in the console and then there should be a yellow triangle pointing at line 13
2013-02-25 12:04:40	tangentstorm	inside the stop sign
2013-02-25 12:04:55	tangentstorm	they're really called breakpoints
2013-02-25 12:04:57	Giraficy	okay
2013-02-25 12:05:04	tangentstorm	now ...
2013-02-25 12:05:53	tangentstorm	under the debug menu you should have a lot more options now
2013-02-25 12:05:53	tangentstorm	including "debug windows"
2013-02-25 12:06:20	tangentstorm	turn on watches, dissasembly, and call stack
2013-02-25 12:06:44	tangentstorm	the call stack shows where you are in the program
2013-02-25 12:07:04	Giraficy	okay
2013-02-25 12:07:06	tangentstorm	dissasembly shows the actual intel assembly instructions that were generated
2013-02-25 12:07:17	tangentstorm	(or whatever platform i guess)
2013-02-25 12:07:19	Giraficy	umm...
2013-02-25 12:07:20	tangentstorm	watches show the values of your local variables
2013-02-25 12:07:22	Giraficy	is it important to understand?
2013-02-25 12:07:28	Giraficy	disassembly?
2013-02-25 12:07:38	tangentstorm	nah
2013-02-25 12:07:42	Giraficy	okay, good
2013-02-25 12:07:58	tangentstorm	you can skip it, but if you ever want to know what it's doing under the hood, it can come in handy
2013-02-25 12:08:12	tangentstorm	the call stack and watches are much higher level
2013-02-25 12:08:20	tangentstorm	okay... so now...
2013-02-25 12:08:43	tangentstorm	F7 / next line
2013-02-25 12:08:48	tangentstorm	every time you press that, the triangle moves down
2013-02-25 12:09:10	tangentstorm	press it a few times
2013-02-25 12:09:20	tangentstorm	you'll see it starts bouncing around inside the for loop
2013-02-25 12:09:44	tangentstorm	stop when you get in there
2013-02-25 12:10:02	tangentstorm	and then look in the "watches" window
2013-02-25 12:10:03	tangentstorm	under local variables
2013-02-25 12:10:11	tangentstorm	hit f7 a few more times and watch how it changes
2013-02-25 12:10:56	tangentstorm	the idea is you can stop your program at any point and inspect what's going on
2013-02-25 12:10:56	Giraficy	hmm
2013-02-25 12:10:56	Giraficy	okay
2013-02-25 12:11:11	tangentstorm	but if you have a long loop, you can use the "run to cursor" menu option
2013-02-25 12:11:21	tangentstorm	put the cursor on line 19 and do that
2013-02-25 12:12:05	tangentstorm	i is now out of scope and the watch menu should say "no locals"
2013-02-25 12:12:05	tangentstorm	s/menu/window/
2013-02-25 12:12:05	tamper	tangentstorm actually meant: i is now out of scope and the watch window should say "no locals"
2013-02-25 12:12:50	tangentstorm	now you can  do several things on this function call
2013-02-25 12:12:50	tangentstorm	if you want to see what it does, you can step into it
2013-02-25 12:12:50	tangentstorm	(shift+f7)
2013-02-25 12:13:02	tangentstorm	obviously you can just look up above in this case
2013-02-25 12:13:12	tangentstorm	but if you have a big project and lots of files this will take you to the right place
2013-02-25 12:13:35	tangentstorm	but if you don't want to descent into the subroutine, you can step over it
2013-02-25 12:13:35	Giraficy	okay
2013-02-25 12:13:38	tangentstorm	since we put a breakpoint on line 7 it's going to take you inside no matter what you do though
2013-02-25 12:13:59	tangentstorm	so just do debug -> continue
2013-02-25 12:14:17	tangentstorm	which runs until the next breakpoint is encountered, or to the end
2013-02-25 12:14:42	tangentstorm	you should be on line 7 now
2013-02-25 12:14:46	tangentstorm	look at the call stack
2013-02-25 12:14:51	tangentstorm	you'll see it's an actual stack now
2013-02-25 12:15:23	tangentstorm	let's assume we found a bug here.
2013-02-25 12:15:26	tangentstorm	so stop the program
2013-02-25 12:15:35	tangentstorm	debug -> stop debugger
2013-02-25 12:15:41	Giraficy	okay, understood :)
2013-02-25 12:15:45	Giraficy	thank you very much
2013-02-25 12:16:00	tangentstorm	one last thing: move  line 19 up into the function
2013-02-25 12:16:13	tangentstorm	er
2013-02-25 12:16:19	tangentstorm	wow that really would be a bug :D
2013-02-25 12:16:42	tangentstorm	i meant up into the loop
2013-02-25 12:16:46	tangentstorm	so swwap 18 and 19
2013-02-25 12:17:04	tangentstorm	remove the breakpoint on line 13 and just restart

2013-02-25 12:17:57	tangentstorm	and notice that you can inspect the loop variable on the stack by using the watches window and the call stack window together

2013-02-25 12:39:58	mrXone	hey guys!
2013-02-25 12:41:33	mrXone	anyone know why there is so bad reference on the java doc site about parameter characteristics i would like to know if there is a list where it tells you what it has and what it accepts and so on just as i does for arguments but not for parameters if someone could help me out that would be great Thanks in advance

2013-02-25 13:19:56	tangentstorm	you could put it up on github

2013-02-25 13:20:58	Giraficy	and this doesn't have GUI so i don't think so
2013-02-25 13:20:58	tangentstorm	takes about 15 minutes to work though that
2013-02-25 13:21:29	Giraficy	i've used git sometimes
2013-02-25 13:21:35	tangentstorm	oh ok. cool
2013-02-25 13:21:46	tangentstorm	do you use it for your own code?
2013-02-25 13:22:08	Giraficy	i once had a small project with few friends and we used git
2013-02-25 13:22:22	tangentstorm	i wish i'd known what version control was when i was first learning

2013-02-25 13:22:30	brbcoding	Me too...
2013-02-25 13:22:34	Giraficy	but it was so small project so git wasn't very useful
2013-02-25 13:22:50	tangentstorm	i use it even if it's just me coding by myself
2013-02-25 13:23:02	Giraficy	there were 2 branches
2013-02-25 13:23:26	Giraficy	there was almost nothing in one :D
2013-02-25 13:23:28	tangentstorm	or like.. if i download a *.tgz file with some code in it, the first thing I do after unzipping is often "git init; git add *; git commit"
2013-02-25 13:23:46	biio	I wish that my friends would want to use git so I could learn how to do actual group projects with it, not just my own code
2013-02-25 13:23:47	brbcoding	Nice for diffs
2013-02-25 13:23:51	tangentstorm	that way i can mess around and change things
2013-02-25 13:24:03	tangentstorm	yeah, and see the diff of what i changed

2013-02-25 13:28:06	tangentstorm	i did a really cheesy side scroller in pygame when it was first coming out but it was too slow to be usable
2013-02-25 13:28:08	Z_Mass	Ya, should be pretty fun. Finally a lab that is an actual game. It's too bad I have to use SDL though
2013-02-25 13:28:36	brbcoding	Oh sweet... I'm a member now
2013-02-25 13:28:37	tangentstorm	you can build a little abstraction layer on top of it

2013-02-25 13:31:07	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: long time since i saw the kivy site, and never tried it. is it cool?

2013-02-25 13:31:53	Z_Mass	I haven't used it really other than working through the pong example. I imagine once you know your way around it and the kivy language it would be really quick to prototype in
2013-02-25 13:32:21	Z_Mass	Might make that my summer project, do a small android game with it.
2013-02-25 13:32:33	tangentstorm	the last time i tried to make a game in python i was really disappointed... i got spoiled by some of the other tools i'd tried

2013-02-25 13:33:39	Z_Mass	Flixel?
2013-02-25 13:33:56	tangentstorm	i tried to mock up my game in construct 2 and then parse its xml file
2013-02-25 13:34:51	Z_Mass	Hmm, is that like an HTML version of Game Maker?
2013-02-25 13:34:52	tangentstorm	yeah i tried a couple things... flixel + DAME (tilemap editor), unity3d, construct2
2013-02-25 13:34:58	tangentstorm	oh tried game maker too
2013-02-25 13:35:18	tangentstorm	something similar yes but the UI and programming model is very different
2013-02-25 13:35:55	tangentstorm	i  made a space invaders in under an hour or something
2013-02-25 13:36:04	Z_Mass	I was watching the mojam stream and one team made a pretty decent looking game with game maker, was impressed

2013-02-25 13:37:02	biio	at least the Mojang one, no one eever seemed to say anything, except once, at 3AM

2013-02-25 15:23:46	HexByte	I would formulate an opinion towards that question but I didnt understand the code :D
2013-02-25 15:25:09	tangentstorm	it's just a nested loop
2013-02-25 15:25:26	tangentstorm	crockford's complaint would be that i don't have an extra layer of { } around it
2013-02-25 15:25:33	tangentstorm	crockford = jslint :)
2013-02-25 15:34:03	biio	that would be almost all my past TA's complaint too :p

2013-02-25 23:02:12	taternuts	I think it's a scope/closure issue, but I might be overthinking it - I can't seem to get a handle on this closure I create

2013-02-25 23:13:03	tangentstorm	taternuts: simple hack: make it a parameter in the constructor
2013-02-25 23:13:48	tangentstorm	so instead of  new TrendContainer() , say   data = {}; new TrendContainer(data)
2013-02-25 23:14:04	tangentstorm	completely kludgy in that it throws encapsulation out the window, but it'll work :)
2013-02-25 23:14:33	tangentstorm	(and then of course set the var _trendEntries to that parameter.

2013-02-25 23:16:32	taternuts	create the object as data={}
2013-02-25 23:16:51	taternuts	actually I think I'm lost
2013-02-25 23:17:32	taternuts	parameter in the constructor of TrendContainer?
2013-02-25 23:17:33	tangentstorm	you said "I can't seem to get a hold on _trendEntries"
2013-02-25 23:18:04	tangentstorm	you are right that it's a closure... that's why you can't see it. :)
2013-02-25 23:18:33	taternuts	frustrating!
2013-02-25 23:18:51	tangentstorm	doesn't TrendContainer.tEntries show up though?
2013-02-25 23:18:58	taternuts	it seems that the 'key' in that statement always shows up as undefined
2013-02-25 23:19:13	tangentstorm	it does for me
2013-02-25 23:19:15	tangentstorm	oh
2013-02-25 23:19:21	taternuts	let me look at it again, I changed all the names to make sure the namespace stuff wasn't an issue
2013-02-25 23:19:34	tangentstorm	what key?
2013-02-25 23:19:44	taternuts	in _entriesToString
2013-02-25 23:19:51	Penorsaurus	so I'm gettng a server with 12 GBs of memory, I use about 500 mbs.
2013-02-25 23:19:52	Penorsaurus	<Rosefox911> What can I do with the rest?
2013-02-25 23:19:53	tangentstorm	i type TrendContainer.count() and get 1
2013-02-25 23:20:27	taternuts	maybe it's a _proto_ thing?
2013-02-25 23:20:52	taternuts	should I create a function factory?
2013-02-25 23:21:44	taternuts	I figured wrapping it in a function would do the same thing, but I've tried a lot of things besides a function factory
2013-02-25 23:22:54	tangentstorm	taternuts: ... i see what you mean: inside _entriesToString you mean
2013-02-25 23:22:55	taternuts	yeah
2013-02-25 23:22:55	taternuts	I can't figure it out
2013-02-25 23:23:34	taternuts	I wanted to do some cool things by storing them in that initial datastructure, but that's my sticking point
2013-02-25 23:23:53	tangentstorm	yeah javascript is a complete mess and I hate it :)

2013-02-25 23:25:46	taternuts	it's updated if you want to delete last hour of history
2013-02-25 23:26:36	taternuts	but on another, probably more simple note - I have to change the URL for my ajax call like every 5 days

2013-02-25 23:32:15	tangentstorm	i used to work for a company that did old-school asp... was talking to them about working there again and they're all sharepoint now... which is what lead me to try and install it

2013-02-25 23:33:13	tangentstorm	taternuts: i don't know why your code doesn't work here. my hunch is it has something to do with the value of "this", which is what i was hoping the "new" would fix
2013-02-25 23:33:33	taternuts	ahhhh, thank you for validating my frustration
2013-02-25 23:33:58	tangentstorm	honestly, i would scrap this container and just use an array
2013-02-25 23:34:24	tangentstorm	you're really just duplicating what an array already does

2013-02-25 23:46:11	Z_Mass	weechat doesn't seem to like "'s in links. Ya I was reading the xmonad page. Just wondering if anyone has actually tried it
2013-02-25 23:46:37	@chance	ive used xmonad successfully with xfce and gnome
2013-02-25 23:46:42	@chance	so i suppose kde would probably be fine
2013-02-25 23:47:01	@chance	also, weechat works fine with links and quotes in them for me
2013-02-25 23:47:02	tangentstorm	kde deskstop has its own tiling window manager.. not quite as flexible as the other ones out there
2013-02-25 23:47:42	Z_Mass	chance: For me the highlight cut off after the q=
2013-02-25 23:47:42	tangentstorm	i actually don't remember where i found it. it's not on by default :/
2013-02-25 23:48:14	@chance	sounds like a terminal thing tbh not weechat
2013-02-25 23:48:33	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: Hmm, I'll have to look into that. I'm thinking of trying out kde again. I don't care about automatically sending windows places. I just like hjkl + alt for window navigation
2013-02-25 23:52:57	mojoey	still no progress on the IRC client...im *still* stuck on passing the raw_input() call

2013-02-25 23:54:53	tangentstorm	oh i don't have that. sounds nice, Z_Mass :)
2013-02-25 23:55:06	taternuts	tangentstorm: figured it could have been built upon with custom logic for a specific queue
2013-02-25 23:55:07	 *	tangentstorm still wishes he could use the space bar to navigate
2013-02-25 23:55:39	tangentstorm	taternuts: in that case i would also scrap it, and then rebuild it step by step writing the tests first :)
2013-02-25 23:55:57	tangentstorm	that is writing tests first :)
2013-02-25 23:56:47	@chance	im practicing my test writing.
2013-02-25 23:56:49	tangentstorm	taternuts: http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/
2013-02-25 23:57:04	@chance	tomorrow at work im going to do the entire django polls tutorial and write some tests
2013-02-25 23:57:05	@chance	until i cant write tests anymore
2013-02-25 23:57:30	tangentstorm	hmm
2013-02-25 23:57:47	tangentstorm	when people say "write the tests first" that doesn't mean write ALL the tests first
2013-02-25 23:58:10	deadant2	Can somebody help me figure out why some code isnt working?
2013-02-25 23:58:12	tangentstorm	it means: write one small test, then write some code until the test passes
2013-02-25 23:58:23	tangentstorm	then write the next test
2013-02-25 23:58:36	tangentstorm	deadant2: it's probably because it has a bug. next question. :)
2013-02-25 23:58:59	tangentstorm	deadant2: just post your code to pastebin or something and ask your question :)
2013-02-25 23:59:02	deadant2	tangentstorm: Hmmm.. maybe
2013-02-25 23:59:05	deadant2	https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5036018
2013-02-25 23:59:58	tangentstorm	ergh. thanks, but next time name the files *.java in  gist so it syntax highlights :)
2013-02-26 00:00:16	deadant2	For some reason i couldnt name the file if i did that
2013-02-26 00:00:23	deadant2	And wasnt sure what was more important
2013-02-26 00:00:44	tangentstorm	no just name it Student.java instead of Student
2013-02-26 00:00:54	tangentstorm	it'll auto-pick the language. it's weird
2013-02-26 00:01:04	deadant2	Ah ok, didnt think about that
2013-02-26 00:01:52	tangentstorm	(you can actually change it if you click edit this gist or whatever)
2013-02-26 00:01:52	tangentstorm	anyway, what's the question?
2013-02-26 00:02:14	taternuts	tangentstorm: I've looked at it a bunch, but I'll look at it again - I feel like it's just a scope/async thing that is messing it up, because I've gotten the code/class to work when I'm just working with that object
2013-02-26 00:02:28	deadant2	If i say run the driver prog and input 20 deadant 25 2000
2013-02-26 00:02:37	deadant2	All seperately of course
2013-02-26 00:02:53	deadant2	It gives me input mismatch errors(Even though thats the order i have it in)
2013-02-26 00:02:53	taternuts	tangentstorm: I'll definitely check out jasmine thought
2013-02-26 00:03:26	deadant2	And the t1,t2 etc dont get printed when i thought they would (Ie right before the input
2013-02-26 00:05:11	@chance	deadant2: can you also add what your inputing into the program and the error you get?
2013-02-26 00:05:17	@chance	like all of it
2013-02-26 00:05:31	@chance	error messages make it easy for debugging :)
2013-02-26 00:06:47	deadant2	Here is what i inputted and what it asked me
2013-02-26 00:06:48	deadant2	http://pastebin.com/jWT23zjG
2013-02-26 00:07:59	deadant2	Actually that was a bad example
2013-02-26 00:08:39	deadant2	Here is one with normal input but still freaks out http://pastebin.com/zmGsqWXZ
2013-02-26 00:10:06	tangentstorm	taternuts: when i say throw it out and rebuild it, that could mean just copying it to another file and pasting it back in piece by piece... the key point is you test it along the way

2013-02-26 00:11:37	tangentstorm	i don't really have any better way to diagnose something that's gotten that complicated :/

2013-02-26 00:12:03	tangentstorm	(which isn't all that complicated)
2013-02-26 00:12:18	taternuts	I tested it with the 'trend' object + the 'TrendContainer' in ideone and it worked
2013-02-26 00:12:31	taternuts	but I didn't test out the entriesToString method
2013-02-26 00:12:40	taternuts	so I'll start with that

2013-02-26 00:16:06	tangentstorm	deadant2: you have entered a number and then a linefeed
2013-02-26 00:16:26	tangentstorm	deadant2: then you ask for a number and a line... so the line is going to be empty
2013-02-26 00:17:04	tangentstorm	deadant2: then you enter the student name, but the scanner is now expecting the next field, which should be an int
2013-02-26 00:17:51	tangentstorm	deadant2: if you want to separate these values by newlines in your input, you need to consume the line after each one (though the student line doesn't need an extra call to the getLine() thing, because it will read the whole line)
2013-02-26 00:18:02	deadant2	Ok so i typed in 20, and then john
2013-02-26 00:18:15	tangentstorm	yes but you ended the line 20 with a linefeed
2013-02-26 00:18:30	tangentstorm	a linefeed isn't part of the int, so it doesn't get consumed
2013-02-26 00:18:58	tangentstorm	wb bolcselo
2013-02-26 00:19:51	deadant2	You mean a enter sign?
2013-02-26 00:20:55	tangentstorm	taternuts: also by test i meant automated test, like what jasmine offers there, or even just something simple like "if (x != whatever_I_expect) { console.log('x was bad:' + x); }" ... this way you can keep running those tests after every step and you'll know immediately if something breaks
2013-02-26 00:21:05	deadant2	I mean the problem is that i pressed enter and i should have used next() and just did it on a single line?
2013-02-26 00:21:16	tangentstorm	deadant2: i mean you typed the number '2' and then the number '0' and then you pressed the key on your keyboard that says 'enter'
2013-02-26 00:21:17	tangentstorm	or 'return'
2013-02-26 00:21:58	tangentstorm	deadant2: yeah i *think* if you type  20john   and then press enter it'll move to the next line before throwing the error
2013-02-26 00:22:27	tangentstorm	but if you want whitespace or a newline between the id and the name, then you have to consume the newline
2013-02-26 00:23:06	tangentstorm	so stu.setStudentID(inp.nextInt()); inp.nextLine();  and THEN stu.setStudentID(inp.nextInt());
2013-02-26 00:23:23	tangentstorm	er sorry
2013-02-26 00:23:40	tangentstorm	stu.setStudentID(inp.nextInt()); inp.nextLine();  stu.setStudentName(inp.nextLine());
2013-02-26 00:26:52	deadant2	So each space needs a inp.nextLine() ?
2013-02-26 00:27:13	tangentstorm	no if you're hitting space it would be something different
2013-02-26 00:27:35	tangentstorm	if you're hitting enter it'll get rid of anything after the number and up to the newline character
2013-02-26 00:28:46	tangentstorm	s/it'll/the nextLine() method will/
2013-02-26 00:28:47	tamper	tangentstorm actually meant: if you're hitting enter the nextLine() method will get rid of anything after the number and up to the newline character

2013-03-15 17:30:31	Kelet	?
2013-03-15 17:30:32	ShredDurst	i seem to be having trouble making the ball bounce off the paddle when my speed is high
2013-03-15 17:30:47	ShredDurst	the ball will pass through the paddle
2013-03-15 17:31:00	Kelet	no collision is made because it goes so many pixels over in 1 frame that it just jumps over the paddle
2013-03-15 17:31:22	ShredDurst	oh
2013-03-15 17:31:42	ShredDurst	now that you say that it makes me wonder why i didn't think about that first
2013-03-15 17:31:43	Kelet	you can just make it so where it 'fake' detects a collision if it goes past the x position of the paddle
2013-03-15 17:32:00	Kelet	right-end of the paddle I guess more specifically
2013-03-15 17:32:18	ShredDurst	yeah
2013-03-15 17:33:56	ShredDurst	it's moving between 1 and 5 pixels in the x direction at any given time so i guess i should just make it so that the x coordinate of the ball is within the range of the x coordinates of the paddle

2013-03-16 23:34:40	FRodrigues	it tells that is a good implementation
2013-03-16 23:34:41	FRodrigues	lol
2013-03-16 23:35:24	FRodrigues	The multiplication in step 2.b makes the result depend on the order of the
2013-03-16 23:35:25	FRodrigues	fields, yielding a much better hash function if the class has multiple similar fields.
2013-03-16 23:35:25	FRodrigues	For example, if the multiplication were omitted from a String hash function, all
2013-03-16 23:35:25	FRodrigues	anagrams would have identical hash codes. The value 31 was chosen because it is
2013-03-16 23:35:25	FRodrigues	an odd prime. If it were even and the multiplication overflowed, information
2013-03-16 23:35:25	FRodrigues	would be lost, as multiplication by 2 is equivalent to shifting. The advantage of
2013-03-16 23:35:27	FRodrigues	using a prime is less clear, but it is traditional. A nice property of 31 is that the
2013-03-16 23:35:29	FRodrigues	multiplication can be replaced by a shift and a subtraction for better performance:
2013-03-16 23:35:32	FRodrigues	31 * i == (i << 5) - i. Modern VMs do this sort of optimization automatically.

2013-03-16 23:56:31	FRodrigues	but if there's a Piece with the same int I dont want to initialize another
2013-03-16 23:56:59	FRodrigues	It's a int

2013-03-17 00:09:29	FRodrigues	the ArrayList<ArrayList<Node>> its a list of strong connected groups
2013-03-17 00:09:37	FRodrigues	of nodes
2013-03-17 00:10:37	tangentstorm	Hm. Okay. Fair enough, but you can use that exact same pattern to represent a graph.
2013-03-17 00:11:43	tangentstorm	anyway, you can also do the same thing with the adjacentcy list they've provided directly.
2013-03-17 00:11:52	tangentstorm	public void addEdge(Node source, Node target, int weight)
2013-03-17 00:12:33	FRodrigues	what pattern?
2013-03-17 00:13:01	tangentstorm	ArrayList<ArrayList<Node>>
2013-03-17 00:13:42	tangentstorm	Isn't that right there basically the exact definition of a hypergraph?
2013-03-17 00:14:15	tangentstorm	Or just limit the inner ArrayList to two nodes and it's a normal graph :)
2013-03-17 00:14:25	tangentstorm	a list of edges
2013-03-17 00:14:29	tangentstorm	between two nodes
2013-03-17 00:15:47	FRodrigues	the problem
2013-03-17 00:15:59	FRodrigues	is that i can have many connections
2013-03-17 00:16:00	FRodrigues	like
2013-03-17 00:16:03	FRodrigues	1->2
2013-03-17 00:16:05	FRodrigues	1->1
2013-03-17 00:16:07	FRodrigues	1->3
2013-03-17 00:16:11	FRodrigues	1->3
2013-03-17 00:16:17	tangentstorm	yeah
2013-03-17 00:16:41	FRodrigues	with the adjacency list it's easy to see
2013-03-17 00:17:01	FRodrigues	i want all the adjacent nodes of 1
2013-03-17 00:17:09	FRodrigues	and it tells me
2013-03-17 00:17:14	FRodrigues	1, 2, 3
2013-03-17 00:18:46	tangentstorm	i understand the basic idea of graphs and how to model them... i guess what i don't understand is what your actual question is. :)

2013-03-17 00:29:29	tangentstorm	But you don't have to hash the whole object, just the name
2013-03-17 00:30:00	tangentstorm	it doesn't matter that the name happens to be made out of digits. You can just use the normal string hashing java provides.

2013-03-18 15:48:45	ElectricSheep	The address of the buffer will be different.

2013-03-18 21:21:38	Kelet	you can easily turn date string <=> unix time
2013-03-18 21:21:43	Kelet	so that's not a problem
2013-03-18 21:22:17	darkzeroman	Yeah, I see where you're going with it. Let me think about it for a minute
2013-03-18 21:22:24	Kelet	And another possible downside is you're going to need to make it so if there's 2 events at the same time it's handled. You can just check the 2nd, 3rd, 4th element in the array until you get something that doesn't have the same unix time as the 1st event
2013-03-18 21:22:31	Kelet	or you can use a hashmap-like data structure
2013-03-18 21:22:36	Kelet	map unix times to event structures
2013-03-18 21:22:53	Kelet	Or rather map unix times to arrays/lists of events

2013-03-18 21:27:41	darkzeroman	Yeah, I guess I'll have to add a method that will auto insert 5 events if there is one event that occurs on every weekday
2013-03-18 21:28:33	Kelet	darkzeroman: Why don't you just like I said, have a boolean and if you encounter the event and the boolean is true then add the event for the next day, if it's a weekday?
2013-03-18 21:28:33	Kelet	Or do you specifically need it precomputed

2013-03-18 22:47:41	Loot_	for each argument leading with a colon, the output needt to be changed to .: instead of :

2013-03-18 22:48:04	@chance	can you give an example of how you would use it?
2013-03-18 22:48:11	Loot_	it needs to output a:.:b:c

2013-03-18 22:48:28	SomeAsianGuy_	i just failed at doing a unix lab lol

2013-03-18 22:50:49	@chance	$@ is notation to iterate through the scripts args

2013-03-18 22:54:13	Loot_	yeah i'm using $@

2013-03-18 22:55:34	Loot_	the hint my professor gave me:
2013-03-18 22:55:36	Loot_	treating all of the arguments as single list and the ^: only
2013-03-18 22:55:36	Loot_	works at the beginning .....
2013-03-18 22:55:37	Loot_	Those seds need to come before you change all of the :'s to spaces
2013-03-18 22:56:26	@chance	i wouldnt use regular expressions.
2013-03-18 22:56:48	Loot_	how else would i go about it?
2013-03-18 22:56:53	@chance	using a for loop?
2013-03-18 22:57:20	Loot_	yeah the expressions are part of the for
2013-03-18 22:57:54	@chance	so you'll be iterating over a list of words

2013-03-18 22:59:12	Loot_	i think the only other thing

2013-03-18 23:35:21	tangentstorm	so instead of saying if (p2=='s')  you would always say   if ('s'==p2)
2013-03-18 23:35:21	jodie	yea it's always been a problem of mine
2013-03-18 23:35:29	tangentstorm	so if you made this mistake the compiler would catch it.

2013-03-18 23:36:02	tangentstorm	(because you can't assign to constant, so 's'=p2 would fail)
2013-03-18 23:36:05	@intothev01d	thats a really good way to go about it I think, if you have a constant or literal value to check against
2013-03-18 23:37:24	@intothev01d	well, i learned something new today
2013-03-18 23:37:31	@intothev01d	thanks tangentstorm :D

2013-03-18 23:40:37	@intothev01d	when would you have an empty while block?
2013-03-18 23:41:02	@intothev01d	just curious for a use case
2013-03-18 23:41:19	tangentstorm	beats me
2013-03-18 23:41:24	tangentstorm	where did you see it?

2013-03-18 23:41:43	@intothev01d	scroll to the while() section
2013-03-18 23:41:53	tangentstorm	oh
2013-03-18 23:42:51	tangentstorm	hmm
2013-03-18 23:43:01	tangentstorm	while (whitespace) {}
2013-03-18 23:43:07	tangentstorm	in a parser maybe
2013-03-18 23:43:27	tangentstorm	while (whitespace()) {}
2013-03-18 23:43:47	ElectricSheep	intothev01d: Do you mean "If the body of the while() is empty, make that explicit, as:"
2013-03-18 23:43:48	ElectricSheep	?
2013-03-18 23:43:52	@intothev01d	yes
2013-03-18 23:44:25	ElectricSheep	That is because the while() loop is waiting for the return of someFuncReturningBool()
2013-03-18 23:44:25	@intothev01d	ah
2013-03-18 23:44:25	ElectricSheep	You don't need to actually do anything while you wait.
2013-03-18 23:44:31	@intothev01d	cool
2013-03-18 23:44:46	@intothev01d	so waiting on the function return
2013-03-18 23:44:53	@intothev01d	wouldnt be good to put like 5 in there or something though
2013-03-18 23:44:54	@intothev01d	lol
2013-03-18 23:45:07	@intothev01d	makes sense
2013-03-18 23:45:09	tangentstorm	it's going to call it over and over until it returns false
2013-03-18 23:45:18	ElectricSheep	But for readability, it helps to declare an empty body with a comment indicating that you are checking the return of the functino.
2013-03-18 23:45:21	ElectricSheep	*function.
2013-03-18 23:45:55	ElectricSheep	Before continuting.
2013-03-18 23:46:00	ElectricSheep	*continuing.
2013-03-18 23:46:04	ElectricSheep	I am tired.
2013-03-18 23:46:17	tangentstorm	in pascal i find myself saying "repeat until whatever;" quite often.
2013-03-18 23:47:15	tangentstorm	repeat a until b;  in pascal is the same as   do a() while (!b()); in c
2013-03-18 23:48:54	@intothev01d	literally that is the syntax? repeat a until b?
2013-03-18 23:48:58	@intothev01d	thats pretty cool
2013-03-18 23:49:02	tangentstorm	yes
2013-03-18 23:49:19	tangentstorm	it knows if something is a function or not so you don't need the ()
2013-03-18 23:49:30	@intothev01d	neat

2013-03-18 23:59:18	tangentstorm	the [1:] way won't give you an IndexError if the list is empty, the pop version will.
2013-03-18 23:59:38	solarparade	The problem is I have a huge dictionary representing a graph with a bunch of nodes tied together

2013-03-19 00:00:11	solarparade	and I don't know what order the values are in in the dictionary, so if i want to unlink two nodes I don't know the index of the values for that necessarily...
2013-03-19 00:00:18	solarparade	i don't know if that made any sense x)

2013-03-21 01:21:57	@intothev01d	if you just want a compiler you could go with something like mingw
2013-03-21 01:22:16	@intothev01d	or you could get some sort of IDE, most people use Visual Studio on windows
2013-03-21 01:22:25	@intothev01d	they have a free express version

2013-03-21 17:33:00	Tangerine	nothing much. Was wondering if someone could help me with a python question
2013-03-21 17:33:25	@intothev01d	sure. also you can just go ahead and ask it when you come in, no need to ask to ask
2013-03-21 17:33:33	Tangerine	oooh ok
2013-03-21 17:33:57	Tangerine	so i have a class, which is based off the irc client from Twisted
2013-03-21 17:34:16	Tangerine	and I want to add a variable defaulted to False to the class
2013-03-21 17:34:45	Tangerine	how can I make sure that this is added when the variable is initialized?
2013-03-21 17:35:18	Tangerine	I can't replace the __init__ function right? That will just override everything that class i'm basing my class off
2013-03-21 17:40:31	@intothev01d	sounds like simple inheritance. you wouldn't override anything you dont need to… i'd have to look it up
2013-03-21 17:41:49	Tangerine	I'm not too sure how inheritance works
2013-03-21 17:41:50	@intothev01d	so you have a Base class of something and you want to get its functionality but extend it to add more variables or methods
2013-03-21 17:42:11	Tangerine	so i guess theres a predefined class located in twisted.words.protocols.irc.IRCClient
2013-03-21 17:42:19	Tangerine	and when you create a class such as
2013-03-21 17:42:42	@intothev01d	inheritance allows you to get all the stuff of the Base class and add stuff for the class that is inheriting from the Base
2013-03-21 17:42:53	Tangerine	class Bot(IRCClient), it copies all of the properties of IRCClient into the new class BOT
2013-03-21 17:43:35	@intothev01d	yes and its methods
2013-03-21 17:43:41	Tangerine	so I can just state a new __init__ function in my Bot class and it won't affect the __init__ of the IRCClient?
2013-03-21 17:44:04	@intothev01d	that i dont know about, maybe. you'd have to look it up
2013-03-21 17:44:08	Tangerine	*the inherited __init__ of the IRCClient
2013-03-21 17:44:23	Tangerine	I'm not sure how to look that up >.>

2013-03-21 17:52:58	Tangerine	thanks!
2013-03-21 17:54:07	Tangerine	in general, do you define functions in python or classes
2013-03-21 17:54:09	Tangerine	or does it not matter
2013-03-21 17:54:53	@intothev01d	depends on what you're doing
2013-03-21 17:55:27	@intothev01d	classes are objects thats are collections of functions and attributes

2013-03-21 17:58:40	asdioj	Hey all, this may be less of a programming question than a tech support question, I'm using the program eclipse to compile and run c++ code and it's giving me the error Launch Failed. Bianary not found. That would be the programs issue, not anything in my code correct?
2013-03-21 17:59:02	@intothev01d	yep. eclipse pretty much sucks. i never could get it to work properly with c++. you can search on google about it and find the same thing. think theres a way to fix it but cant remember
2013-03-21 18:00:42	asdioj	hmm, ya, I could never get it installed properly on my laptop so I'm in my universities computer lab  right now, can you recommend similar but better programs? I've only ever used this one but it's buggy as hell
2013-03-21 18:00:49	@intothev01d	Visual Studio, they have a free express edition

2013-03-22 19:14:34	Tangerine	hmm i seem to have "kinda" solved it by putting points first instead of username, since I know points will always be an integer under 10
2013-03-22 19:16:26	tangentstorm	them ol' string formattin operations is just what you need there, Tangerine, seein' as how you can arrange all them fields to occupy certain widths...

2013-03-22 19:30:02	Tangerine	oh but I want to format it too
2013-03-22 19:30:03	Tangerine	i think i figured it out
2013-03-22 19:30:10	Tangerine	since my number only goes from 0-10, i'll be fine
2013-03-22 19:30:38	Tangerine	i ended up with '{:2d}'.format(number)
2013-03-22 19:31:39	@chance	if you want a table you might look at pprint

2013-03-22 19:32:11	@intothev01d	im curious, will python type convert stuff for you like that? say something takes a string and you give it an int, will it convert that to a string automatically or do you have to specify?
2013-03-22 19:32:38	@chance	nothing "takes a string"
2013-03-22 19:32:38	@chance	it takes an object
2013-03-22 19:32:41	@chance	which may be a string, or anything else.
2013-03-22 19:32:56	Tangerine	mm ok

2013-03-22 19:33:28	@intothev01d	just in general
2013-03-22 19:33:28	@chance	well ti depends

2013-03-22 19:34:20	@chance	if its a string method, than it will call the __repr__ of the object when interpolating it into the string
2013-03-22 19:36:58	@chance	if you use % and you put "%d" as your format string, than it requires an int
2013-03-22 19:37:42	@chance	the "%s" format string just converts any object using str()
2013-03-22 19:37:59	@chance	and for details on that

2013-03-22 19:38:31	tangentstorm	Tangerine: format is a method of a string. you can say   "{0}{1}{0}{1}".format((1212,65536)) and it'll make a mess.
2013-03-22 19:38:51	Tangerine	oooh ok
2013-03-22 19:39:22	Tangerine	wow come to think of it, I haven't been using the %s method of creating strings
2013-03-22 19:39:27	tangentstorm	and then if you use some of those codes you can make the various numbers right or left aligned to various column widths
2013-03-22 19:39:32	Tangerine	I've been just doing 'I have' + str(5) + 'apples'
2013-03-22 19:39:48	Tangerine	this was so far back in learning python that I've forgotten it haha
2013-03-22 19:39:54	@chance	whats nice is with .format() things are re-usable
2013-03-22 19:40:01	tangentstorm	"%i" % 5 works too... format is nicer but i'm so used to % that i don't know the {} syntax
2013-03-22 19:40:26	@chance	{} lets you access array/dict/object methods
2013-03-22 19:40:28	@chance	int he string

2013-03-22 19:45:12	@intothev01d	take
2013-03-22 19:45:44	tangentstorm	well, most of them are kind of all the same
2013-03-22 19:46:03	tangentstorm	there's really not that much difference between java,python,ruby,c,pascal,etc.
2013-03-22 19:46:29	tangentstorm	well c and old pascal lack objects ... c++ and object pascal then :)
2013-03-22 19:46:57	tangentstorm	aside from that, they're pretty darn close to each other.
2013-03-22 19:47:56	@intothev01d	yea thats true. I was just looking up differences in ruby and python, they seem very similiar but they have unique points. guess thats what i like to know. have a better understanding of them http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonVsRuby

2013-03-22 20:18:27	tangentstorm	This is interesting: both AggPas, and ZenGL treat images as pointers to something like a 2d array of pixels inside another 2d array of pixels.
2013-03-22 20:18:48	tangentstorm	Like a sub-rectangle.
2013-03-22 20:19:17	tangentstorm	So instead of just width and height, you have width, height, and stride, where stride is the distance in ram from one row to the next.
2013-03-22 20:20:22	tangentstorm	And so you can work efficiently with a sub-image.

2013-03-22 20:21:37	carefish	isn't it width * height * channels ?
2013-03-22 20:23:32	tangentstorm	Well, imagine you have a 100x100 image.
2013-03-22 20:24:02	tangentstorm	Make it completely white and then somewhere in there add a 10x10 black square.
2013-03-22 20:24:38	tangentstorm	With the model these units use, you can have a "image" or rendering buffer or whatever that only deals with that black square.
2013-03-22 20:25:23	tangentstorm	the stride would be 100, the width of the larger image.
2013-03-22 20:26:05	tangentstorm	if the stride is equal to the width then it's a normal image.

2013-03-22 20:26:24	tangentstorm	i guess if the stride is negative then the image is upside down... hmm.
2013-03-22 20:28:49	tangentstorm	Huh. You could also extend the idea to get only the blue channel, or possibly only the blue channel of a subimage, if you chained the arithmetic expressions together.

2013-03-23 23:11:23	Shadowhawk109	Got a git question for ya: I want to make a new Git repo (already have an empty one on Github) that has all the files AND history from a DIFFERENT repo.  I could do this with branching, but I'd rather have a seperate folder/repo.
2013-03-23 23:14:36	@intothev01d	force push everything to the new repo?
2013-03-23 23:14:52	@intothev01d	add it as a remote and force push to it
2013-03-23 23:15:09	Shadowhawk109	interesting
2013-03-23 23:15:19	@intothev01d	is the new repo empty?
2013-03-23 23:15:22	Shadowhawk109	doesnt that overwrite the old one
2013-03-23 23:15:22	Shadowhawk109	yes
2013-03-23 23:15:41	@intothev01d	it will overwrite whatever you have at the new repo
2013-03-23 23:16:04	Shadowhawk109	so cd old_repo_directory
2013-03-23 23:16:17	Shadowhawk109	git remote add new_repo_location_on_github
2013-03-23 23:16:18	Shadowhawk109	?
2013-03-23 23:16:39	@intothev01d	yea
2013-03-23 23:17:50	@intothev01d	I'm trying to think b/c i've done this or similar before and thats how i got stuff over i believe
2013-03-23 23:18:11	@intothev01d	either way, worst case is you somehow muck up the new repo, but its empty now so
2013-03-23 23:18:23	Shadowhawk109	i'd think that'd break my old repo tho, wouldnt it
2013-03-23 23:18:31	Shadowhawk109	cause it wouldnt know it's own repo anymore
2013-03-23 23:18:33	Shadowhawk109	just the new one
2013-03-23 23:18:38	@intothev01d	what?
2013-03-23 23:18:48	@intothev01d	you can have multiple locations to push code to
2013-03-23 23:18:50	@intothev01d	thats the point of remotes
2013-03-23 23:18:54	Shadowhawk109	oh okay
2013-03-23 23:18:57	@intothev01d	git is a distributed vcs
2013-03-23 23:19:04	@intothev01d	so everything is its own repo basically
2013-03-23 23:19:44	@intothev01d	what you're really doing there is just adding a new location to push or pull from, then you're force pushing your current code to that location
2013-03-23 23:20:50	Shadowhawk109	so git remote add --mirror (push/fetch) <name> <url>
2013-03-23 23:21:04	Shadowhawk109	name = blank, and just push cause i dont want this folder to be able to fetch, yes?
2013-03-23 23:21:25	@intothev01d	git remote add <name> <url> thats all you'll need
2013-03-23 23:21:37	@intothev01d	you will just be pushing at this point
2013-03-23 23:21:38	Shadowhawk109	i see
2013-03-23 23:22:26	@intothev01d	you can see using git remote -v the list of places you can push/pull from then
2013-03-23 23:22:40	@intothev01d	you should have the original repo and the new one you added
2013-03-23 23:23:35	Shadowhawk109	yup
2013-03-23 23:23:42	Shadowhawk109	so how to i get the new one to have all the old stuff
2013-03-23 23:23:49	Shadowhawk109	cause i dont have anything to push right now
2013-03-23 23:24:05	@intothev01d	make a small change or something
2013-03-23 23:24:53	@intothev01d	git add, git commit, git push -f master <new repo name from your remotes>
2013-03-23 23:25:13	Shadowhawk109	oops, just did a normal git-push >_<
2013-03-23 23:25:16	Shadowhawk109	sec

2013-03-23 23:29:01	Shadowhawk109	gotcha.
2013-03-23 23:29:11	Shadowhawk109	oh sick, its doing things
2013-03-23 23:29:13	@intothev01d	it should be
2013-03-23 23:29:13	Shadowhawk109	thanks a bunch!
2013-03-23 23:29:39	@intothev01d	you have all your code in the new repo?
2013-03-23 23:29:59	Shadowhawk109	dont know yet :| im currently tethered to a 3G phone because its faster than my shitty dial-up
2013-03-23 23:30:12	@intothev01d	ok

2013-03-23 23:34:15	@intothev01d	i'd probably kill myself :D
2013-03-23 23:34:36	Shadowhawk109	as i tell my friends: "I don't write buggy code, because it takes too long to commit a fix."
2013-03-23 23:35:04	@intothev01d	yea makes you much more careful lol
2013-03-23 23:35:37	Shadowhawk109	welp i'm all good now, excellent. thanks again!

2013-03-23 23:36:08	@intothev01d	it may not be the "most correct way" you can prob search for it and find other solutions but i've just done it that way before
2013-03-23 23:36:22	@intothev01d	should have all the history etc attached as well right?

2013-03-23 23:59:06	bolcselo	just got my first smartphone
2013-03-23 23:59:19	bolcselo	why arent there better apps for this thing
2013-03-24 00:00:35	bolcselo	think ill build orage
2013-03-24 00:10:04	tangentstorm	what phone, bolcselo?
2013-03-24 00:10:15	tangentstorm	and did you see that tetris thing I linked earlier? :)
2013-03-24 00:14:08	bolcselo	yeah
2013-03-24 00:15:07	bolcselo	he used a premade event handling library though
2013-03-24 00:15:44	tangentstorm	it's sort of part of what comes with gw-basic i guess.
2013-03-24 00:15:44	tangentstorm	the music thing too.
2013-03-24 00:16:49	tangentstorm	"play" to play an ansi music string was a builtin feature in the global namespace

2013-03-24 00:19:58	bolcselo	built in ega support too
2013-03-24 00:19:58	tangentstorm	yeah, and all the graphics commands (lines, circles, etc...)
2013-03-24 00:20:24	bolcselo	when is it ok for me to learn another language
2013-03-24 00:20:27	tangentstorm	Turbo pascal was the same way. It didn't have a canned music system but you could set the speaker to any tone you wanted.
2013-03-24 00:20:28	bolcselo	from a structured point of view
2013-03-24 00:20:39	tangentstorm	You are asking the wrong guy about that. :D
2013-03-24 00:20:48	bolcselo	lies
2013-03-24 00:21:02	tangentstorm	I just jump in.
2013-03-24 00:21:32	bolcselo	i mean to say, if i get the oreilly perl handbook will i be lost from a nooby c background
2013-03-24 00:21:36	tangentstorm	Though... I usually have one language that's my "main" language for getting stuff done in, no matter what I'm experimenting with.
2013-03-24 00:22:28	tangentstorm	It's always going to be overwhelming at first.
2013-03-24 00:22:44	bolcselo	lisp rather, not perl
2013-03-24 00:23:13	bolcselo	python was not overwhelming at all
2013-03-24 00:23:13	tangentstorm	Really? Hmm. It was for me :)
2013-03-24 00:23:49	tangentstorm	I guess that's the benefit of the guided tour approach. :)
2013-03-24 00:25:31	tangentstorm	I guess I kind of like being confused and disoriented.
2013-03-24 00:25:57	bolcselo	psh pretention
2013-03-24 00:26:08	tangentstorm	?
2013-03-24 00:26:17	bolcselo	cont give me that question mark
2013-03-24 00:26:23	bolcselo	dont*
2013-03-24 00:26:41	bolcselo	anyway
2013-03-24 00:26:55	bolcselo	appraently lisp is the next step academically
2013-03-24 00:27:04	tangentstorm	I mean: I guess it's more interesting to jump into an environment or tool that hardly anyone else is using.
2013-03-24 00:28:59	tangentstorm	Like ruby seems nice, but I probably won't ever really learn it unless I have a ruby project, because it's too much like python.

2013-04-21 13:26:44	Amadiro	my homegrown game-engine now runs on win, linux, osx, android and the raspberry pi
2013-04-21 13:27:35	Amadiro	jesyspa, chance erlang does the same thing, btw; it spawns a number of scheduler queues (preferrably corresponding to your number of CPUs) and then schedules your processes to run on those (trying to give processes that talk to eachother often the same scheduler queue)
2013-04-21 17:28:07	@chance	Amadiro: is based on subprocesses or threads?
2013-04-21 17:28:36	Amadiro	chance, I think it can switch. It can also keep a pool of async i/o threads for certain blocking operations, et cetera.

2013-04-21 17:49:40	Amadiro	no game, just a portable game-engine
2013-04-21 17:49:47	Amadiro	it uses OpenGL ES 2.0
2013-04-21 17:50:06	jesyspa	I mean, targetted at what kind/genre of games?
2013-04-21 17:50:39	Amadiro	anything, really, it's opengl, so both 2D and 3D games are possible
2013-04-21 17:50:56	Amadiro	although I'm really not aiming for 3D games, if I want to support weak devices like the raspberry pi or low-end androids

2013-04-21 18:28:57	Oathyyy	c
2013-04-21 18:29:39	jesyspa	Hm, last I remember you need to fopen the file, then use fwrite or fprintf to write to it, then fclose it.
2013-04-21 18:29:55	jesyspa	Then later on fopen it again, fread of fscanf from it, and then fclose it again.

2013-04-21 18:32:26	jesyspa	If you're populating the file, then how do you know where the end should be?
2013-04-21 18:32:49	Oathyyy	i need to populate 10 rows and 3 columns
2013-04-21 18:33:19	Oathyyy	Would it be easier if I sent you a link to the assignment?
2013-04-21 18:33:19	jesyspa	Nope.
2013-04-21 18:33:19	Oathyyy	ok
2013-04-21 18:33:39	jesyspa	It sounds like you want to loop over [0,10) and then over [0,3) inside that.
2013-04-21 18:34:19	Oathyyy	I'm not sure I am understanding
2013-04-21 18:34:38	jesyspa	You want a for loop going from 0 to 10, including 0 but not including 10.  Inside that, you want a for loop going from 0 to 3, including 0 but not including 3.
2013-04-21 18:35:10	jesyspa	Perhaps pass 10 and 3 as parameters.
2013-04-21 18:36:24	Oathyyy	Hmmmm, ok ill give it a shot
2013-04-21 18:37:09	Oathyyy	Thanks for the help

2013-04-21 19:54:22	skololo	LL(1) vs SLR(1) vs LR(1) vs LALR(1), top down, bottom up, ass first, bleh
2013-04-21 20:00:21	WolfSaint	Is lazy evaluation the ass first one?
2013-04-21 20:02:22	skololo	Hahahahah, no. Thank god, we don't have to worry about how to compile functional languages. :p
2013-04-21 20:03:35	skololo	I feel like I've got a pretty good handle on the basics, but the specifics of getting LR(0) items and table construction has me in a mental pretzel

2013-04-23 00:37:32	@intothev01d	yea i love how you can access and create so many layers
2013-04-23 00:41:21	Z_Mass	I used json for a fiew of my game dev labs as conf files. Was nice not having to recompile as well :)
2013-04-23 00:47:07	tangentstorm	you doing ludum dare this weekend, Z_Mass ?
2013-04-23 00:49:46	Z_Mass	Not sure, this is the first I hear of it lol
2013-04-23 00:50:14	Z_Mass	I've never really looked into ludum dare apart from their tools page

2013-04-23 00:50:22	Z_Mass	you?
2013-04-23 00:51:03	tangentstorm	maybe. it would be nice to actually finish a game
2013-04-23 00:52:11	tangentstorm	if i do i'll probably use zengl, maybe along with my game library if i get it ported over fast enough.
2013-04-23 01:08:44	@intothev01d	tangentstorm: did they ever do anything about mods in learnprogramming?
2013-04-23 01:10:17	tangentstorm	i don't think so.
2013-04-23 01:12:18	@intothev01d	huh, oh well. they must need some help if they asked so mabye eventually someone else will be one
2013-04-23 01:12:18	tamper	huh: À bientôt!
2013-04-23 01:12:22	tangentstorm	nope.. still just the same three moderators... i guess they changed their mind.

2013-04-24 22:59:29	taternuts	I learned the other day it was pronounced "Lateck", definitely thought it was just latex
2013-04-24 23:00:05	zebbiz	yeah, confused me at first too
2013-04-24 23:00:05	viiralvx	Hahaha
2013-04-24 23:00:05	viiralvx	taternuts: ME TOO
2013-04-24 23:00:05	zebbiz	but I still use latex
2013-04-24 23:00:05	viiralvx	I heard one of my professors say "La-Teck"
2013-04-24 23:00:07	viiralvx	And I was so confused.
2013-04-24 23:00:34	viiralvx	Also, after reading that comic, I just realized
2013-04-24 23:00:46	viiralvx	That I've programmed something in every single one of those languages in the past two years.
2013-04-24 23:00:47	taternuts	I think I saw it on a reddit or hacker news post, something about self-taught programmers that just haven't heard people say it in real life
2013-04-24 23:01:17	viiralvx	Meh, I'm 50% self-taught programmer, other 50% from my University. I actually don't really learn shit from my University.
2013-04-24 23:01:44	taternuts	yeah I went the BS in I.T. route, so I didn't learn much programming
2013-04-24 23:01:44	viiralvx	I just it in class and work on side projects during lectures.
2013-04-24 23:01:49	viiralvx	Yeah, my older sister was an IT major.
2013-04-24 23:01:55	taternuts	I had 3-4 classes, 2 of which I took for fun
2013-04-24 23:02:06	viiralvx	I'm a Computer Science/Graphic Design major, it's just that archaic shit.
2013-04-24 23:02:11	taternuts	but I got a job as a dev and learned from that mostly
2013-04-24 23:02:32	viiralvx	Niceeee
2013-04-24 23:02:35	viiralvx	I'm sort of nervous
2013-04-24 23:02:44	viiralvx	I got an internship as a developer
2013-04-24 23:02:45	viiralvx	This summer.
2013-04-24 23:02:48	viiralvx	With IBM.
2013-04-24 23:02:54	viiralvx	So I'm really nervous.
2013-04-24 23:03:09	taternuts	while it's nice to have a CS slant, most programming for business apps don't require much math, CS theory, or even much knowledge of data structures
2013-04-24 23:03:13	tangentstorm	congrats, viiralvx
2013-04-24 23:03:21	taternuts	just bust your ass, you'll do great

2013-04-24 23:03:42	Plazma	congrats viiralvx !
2013-04-24 23:03:48	viiralvx	taternuts: My problem lies in that if I'm not emotionally/mentally invested in a  project, I won't put my 100% effort into it. Hence why school is boring to me.
2013-04-24 23:03:49	viiralvx	Plazma: Thanks!
2013-04-24 23:03:51	Plazma	lots of coding beforehand i assume?
2013-04-24 23:03:57	Plazma	before you went into it i guess
2013-04-24 23:04:00	viiralvx	I've only been programming
2013-04-24 23:04:01	viiralvx	For 2 years.
2013-04-24 23:04:02	taternuts	viiralvx: I struuuuggled through school
2013-04-24 23:04:08	zebbiz	viiralvx: IBM, nice
2013-04-24 23:04:15	taternuts	viiralvx: when you're on the job and being challenged, you're going to be interested
2013-04-24 23:04:37	taternuts	viiralvx: you're gonna do great, just give it your all
2013-04-24 23:04:40	viiralvx	taternuts: Yeah, school is challenging but I honestly do not care at all about Turing Machines, Pushdown Automata, etc.
2013-04-24 23:04:51	zebbiz	^
2013-04-24 23:05:03	taternuts	viiralvx: you want to build things
2013-04-24 23:05:28	viiralvx	taternuts: Yep. That's why compared to my classmates, I may have the crappiest GPA, but I have the most experience with GitHub, web application development, and mobile application development.
2013-04-24 23:05:59	Plazma	so i saw this thing on Pawn Stars that they made for the navy back in the old days.. (US ) .. it was a instruction manual on how to read the stars to navigate.. and while it had boring stuff.. teh charts were naked chicks in poses, and stars covering the naughty bits.. and those stars made the navigation constellatoins
2013-04-24 23:05:59	Plazma	such a neat concept
2013-04-24 23:06:25	viiralvx	Hahahaha, that's so dope.
2013-04-24 23:06:42	viiralvx	God, Android app development is a pain in the butt.
2013-04-24 23:06:45	viiralvx	At times.
2013-04-24 23:06:47	zebbiz	giggity
2013-04-24 23:07:01	Plazma	i guess the question is.. why isn't that being used today on the internets :p
2013-04-24 23:07:13	zebbiz	how?
2013-04-24 23:07:23	Plazma	i dont' know
2013-04-24 23:07:34	Plazma	but i'm sure you can pseudocode something on a breast somehow
2013-04-24 23:07:45	viiralvx	I'll pseudocode my DNA onto a breast.
2013-04-24 23:07:59	taternuts	that would be a lot of pseudocode
2013-04-24 23:08:48	Plazma	maybe you can be recursive or have an infinite loop for the naughty bits

2013-04-24 23:10:06	taternuts	I still say gif, not jif
2013-04-24 23:10:28	zebbiz	Why would you say jif?
2013-04-24 23:10:30	Plazma	jiff is for peanutbutter
2013-04-24 23:10:41	taternuts	I've literally joked on someone for that
2013-04-24 23:10:48	taternuts	but I think it might be 'jiff'
2013-04-24 23:11:10	taternuts	"Jiff?? Are we talking peanut butter?"
2013-04-24 23:11:18	Plazma	who the hell calls it C pound
2013-04-24 23:11:25	taternuts	I call it c number
2013-04-24 23:11:32	zebbiz	c-sharp
2013-04-24 23:11:45	tangentstorm	the name is actually My Ess Cue Ell

2013-04-24 23:12:45	taternuts	do most people actually say 'S-Q-L'? I've always heard sequel
2013-04-24 23:12:50	Akiva-Mobile	because I really dislike c++
2013-04-24 23:13:08	tangentstorm	it's "sequel" but My-S-Q-L
2013-04-24 23:13:09	Akiva-Mobile	it just seems so easy for me to write garbage in it
2013-04-24 23:13:22	tangentstorm	Akiva-Mobile: pascal :)
2013-04-24 23:13:23	zebbiz	I say SQL
2013-04-24 23:13:32	Akiva-Mobile	tangentstorm: is that so...?
2013-04-24 23:13:34	taternuts	I say sql
2013-04-24 23:13:37	taternuts	er sequel
2013-04-24 23:13:47	tangentstorm	I say oh-s-ex too.. :D
2013-04-24 23:13:57	tangentstorm	ever though i know better.
2013-04-24 23:13:58	Akiva-Mobile	worst one is Post-Gress-Que-el
2013-04-24 23:13:58	tangentstorm	oh-es-ex i mean :D
2013-04-24 23:14:41	taternuts	spelling postgresql is so hard for me
2013-04-24 23:14:43	taternuts	postgressql every time
2013-04-24 23:15:19	zebbiz	tangentstorm: how are you suppose to say it?
2013-04-24 23:15:22	tangentstorm	Akiva-Mobile: check it out... feels very pythonic to me. most of the keywords are the same. it's got a strong static type system but you can use variants and interfaces if you want dynamic types and (ref-counted) garbage collection.
2013-04-24 23:15:27	viiralvx	I hate
2013-04-24 23:15:28	viiralvx	Recursion
2013-04-24 23:15:29	viiralvx	I HATE IT
2013-04-24 23:15:30	viiralvx	Btw guys
2013-04-24 23:15:31	taternuts	I think you say it "Post Gres SQL"
2013-04-24 23:15:33	viiralvx	Im' getting a weird error.
2013-04-24 23:15:35	tangentstorm	o-s 10 i guess
2013-04-24 23:15:46	viiralvx	So I'm building a web app and parsing Youtube Videos from their page
2013-04-24 23:15:48	taternuts	but it's spelled almagamating the S from Gre's' and 'S'ql
2013-04-24 23:15:51	taternuts	I think
2013-04-24 23:16:01	Akiva-Mobile	taternuts: That is redundant
2013-04-24 23:16:02	viiralvx	So when I'm running the server (it's in CherryPy and Python)
2013-04-24 23:16:07	Akiva-Mobile	because its postgre
2013-04-24 23:16:08	viiralvx	Locally, the server works great
2013-04-24 23:16:16	viiralvx	but then when I'm running it on heroku and trying it out there
2013-04-24 23:16:34	taternuts	ah that's where I'm messing up
2013-04-24 23:16:35	viiralvx	The music/stream URL that I parsed from YouTube's HTML isn't working.
2013-04-24 23:16:35	taternuts	I've always read it as "post gres sql"
2013-04-24 23:16:48	viiralvx	It's tossing a 403 error
2013-04-24 23:16:50	taternuts	but then again I don't have much exp with it

2013-04-24 23:27:36	viiralvx	Aka, the .mp4 file, hahaha.
2013-04-24 23:28:20	taternuts	does it stay the same each time you try it
2013-04-24 23:28:28	taternuts	or does it load the same url

2013-04-24 23:28:48	viiralvx	taternuts: But, I can re-use it for about an hour or so, I believe. Not sure how long it goes for until it expires.
2013-04-24 23:29:13	taternuts	looks kind of like a callback for that call
2013-04-24 23:29:34	taternuts	but I dont' really known to be honest

2013-04-24 23:30:31	viiralvx	Or is it a 403?
2013-04-24 23:30:34	taternuts	403
2013-04-24 23:30:40	viiralvx	Fufufufu.

2013-04-24 23:31:56	viiralvx	Plazma: Anyway to sidestep that? it works locally, how would I be able to forward that to people outside of my network?
2013-04-24 23:32:02	taternuts	I would if I knew pascal

2013-04-24 23:43:08	taternuts	ok so it's friday night EST?
2013-04-24 23:43:13	taternuts	what's your timezone
2013-04-24 23:43:22	tangentstorm	i'm in central time.

2013-04-24 23:43:55	taternuts	it looked like a mixture of js and python
2013-04-24 23:44:12	tangentstorm	that's because both languages drew heavily on pascal for inspiration.

2013-04-24 23:54:33	tangentstorm	:) i'd really like to get pascal (or a dialect of pascal) running in a browser. that's what my compiler project is mainly about.
2013-04-24 23:55:07	tangentstorm	once i have that working i'll start recording my lessons.
2013-04-24 23:56:40	taternuts	oh man definitely heard about delphi before
2013-04-24 23:57:51	taternuts	did pascal come about the same time as erlang?
2013-04-24 23:58:03	tangentstorm	no... pascal was created back in the 1960's
2013-04-24 23:58:17	taternuts	oh damnm
2013-04-24 23:58:38	tangentstorm	but turbo pascal came out in the late 80's... it was pretty big in the 90's
2013-04-24 23:58:47	tangentstorm	in the DOS days.
2013-04-24 23:59:10	tangentstorm	then when windows came out, they dropped turbo pascal and focused on delphi.
2013-04-24 23:59:12	taternuts	I've heard of them through my dad, probably (56)
2013-04-24 23:59:55	tangentstorm	delphi is still alive and kicking but they took a huge  beating from microsoft and they also kind of mismanaged things on their own end.
2013-04-25 00:00:22	taternuts	does it power anything noteable? just curious
2013-04-25 00:00:22	tangentstorm	so it got passed around between a bunch of different companies, and you have to pay like $250 just for the "intro" edition.
2013-04-25 00:00:30	tangentstorm	skype was written in delphi.
2013-04-25 00:00:41	taternuts	well there you go
2013-04-25 00:00:42	tangentstorm	photoshop was originall written in object pascal.
2013-04-25 00:00:46	taternuts	pretty cool
2013-04-25 00:00:49	Plazma	you can get the original photoshop code
2013-04-25 00:00:51	Plazma	in pascal
2013-04-25 00:00:56	Plazma	it's free in the internet archives or whatever
2013-04-25 00:01:09	Plazma	same with macpaint or something i think..
2013-04-25 00:01:45	tangentstorm	of course lazarus and freepascal are also written in pascal :)

2013-04-25 01:31:50	Akiva-Mobile	you see, this is a great way to compare what is the best programming layout
2013-04-25 01:31:56	jesyspa	No, it isn't.
2013-04-25 01:31:59	Akiva-Mobile	lets create a line of code
2013-04-25 01:32:03	jesyspa	It's a great way to spam the channel.
2013-04-25 01:32:06	Akiva-Mobile	and see who can type the fstest.
2013-04-25 01:32:21	tangentstorm	ugh
2013-04-25 01:32:51	WolfSaint	What is this a J computation.
2013-04-25 01:32:51	tangentstorm	okay: how about making a little game where you can do this? :D
2013-04-25 01:32:51	jesyspa	Seeing as network lag is the dominant force anyway.
2013-04-25 01:32:51	hg341	lets see who can make a program to complete a test the fastest witht he fewest bugs
2013-04-25 01:32:51	Akiva-Mobile	okay okay, i'll leave you in peace
2013-04-25 01:33:09	Akiva-Mobile	hg341: good idea, but I will lose; I am a newbie programmer
2013-04-25 01:33:21	 *	tangentstorm offers up the canned tests from learntris.
2013-04-25 01:33:21	hg341	im worse
2013-04-25 01:33:36	tangentstorm	https://github.com/LearnProgramming/learntris
2013-04-25 01:33:37	Akiva-Mobile	hg341: you are an admin though, so i doubt it :P
2013-04-25 01:33:44	hg341	?
2013-04-25 01:33:54	tangentstorm	the tests are defined here: https://github.com/LearnProgramming/learntris/blob/testsuite/ltclient/tests/basics.py
2013-04-25 01:34:00	hg341	no that was a joke
2013-04-25 01:34:17	hg341	i dont know python
2013-04-25 01:34:21	hg341	just c++
2013-04-25 01:34:21	hg341	and a tiny bit of java
2013-04-25 01:34:34	tangentstorm	the tests can run against any language as long as you write to stdout.
2013-04-25 01:34:34	tangentstorm	and read from stdin.
2013-04-25 01:34:38	jesyspa	If you actually know C++, Python isn't going to be much of an issue.
2013-04-25 01:35:00	Akiva-Mobile	print "Hello World"
2013-04-25 01:35:00	Akiva-Mobile	I win!
2013-04-25 01:35:02	tangentstorm	here is a pascal implementation: https://github.com/tangentstorm/learntris/blob/refimp/ltbios.pas
2013-04-25 01:35:07	Akiva-Mobile	(assuming its not 3.0)
2013-04-25 01:35:19	WolfSaint	"Hello World"
2013-04-25 01:35:19	WolfSaint	I used J
2013-04-25 01:35:20	zebbiz	First to write a method to calculate factorials!
2013-04-25 01:35:25	zebbiz	(defun fn(n)(if(<= n 1) 1 (* n (fn (- n 1)))))
2013-04-25 01:35:25	hg341	ha
2013-04-25 01:35:34	zebbiz	I WIN
2013-04-25 01:35:34	hg341	haha im learning cPP
2013-04-25 01:35:34	Akiva-Mobile	bah
2013-04-25 01:35:35	Akiva-Mobile	lol
2013-04-25 01:36:00	hg341	i do not know c++
2013-04-25 01:36:04	zebbiz	hg341: that was lisp
2013-04-25 01:36:23	hg341	"jesyspa>	If you actually know C++, Python isn't going to be much of an issue."
2013-04-25 01:36:27	zebbiz	true
2013-04-25 01:36:56	hg341	i was referring to that
2013-04-25 01:37:15	zebbiz	time to get ready for school!
2013-04-25 01:38:30	tangentstorm	>>> import operator; fact = lambda n : reduce(operator.mul, range(1,n+1))
2013-04-25 01:39:51	WolfSaint	fact?
2013-04-25 01:40:02	tangentstorm	factorial
2013-04-25 01:40:09	tangentstorm	>>> fact(5)
2013-04-25 01:40:09	tangentstorm	120
2013-04-25 01:40:23	jesyspa	f = (!!) $ scanl (*) 1 [1..]
2013-04-25 01:41:06	tangentstorm	is that point free haskell, jesyspa?
2013-04-25 01:41:06	jesyspa	Yes.
2013-04-25 01:41:06	tangentstorm	what does !! do?
2013-04-25 01:41:10	<--	justfielding (~fielding@ip184-180-244-54.ks.ks.cox.net) has quit (Read error: Operation timed out)
2013-04-25 01:41:10	jesyspa	element-at.
2013-04-25 01:41:24	tangentstorm	neat
2013-04-25 01:42:15	WolfSaint	Sounds like I should learn haskell
2013-04-25 01:43:19	tangentstorm	i think in j, it's:  */i.
2013-04-25 01:43:22	tangentstorm	not sure how to make it a function though.
2013-04-25 01:43:34	jesyspa	Alternatively...
2013-04-25 01:43:36	jesyspa	(((S ((L ((R R) I)) ((S I) I))) ((L ((R R) I)) ((S I) I))) ((R (S ((L ((L ((R <=) I)) 1)) 1))) ((R (S ((R *) I))) ((L ((R R) I)) ((L ((R -) I)) 1)))))
2013-04-25 01:43:48	tangentstorm	much clearer.
2013-04-25 01:43:49	WolfSaint	Is that erlang?
2013-04-25 01:43:56	jesyspa	No, not as far as I know.
2013-04-25 01:44:27	tangentstorm	combinatory logic
2013-04-25 01:44:36	tangentstorm	dunno what the L combinator does
2013-04-25 01:44:54	tangentstorm	okay i don't know what any of them do :D
2013-04-25 01:45:15	tangentstorm	i'm guessing you compiled that from the original?
2013-04-25 01:45:35	WolfSaint	I don't recall what a factorial is.
2013-04-25 01:45:40	tangentstorm	5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
2013-04-25 01:45:50	WolfSaint	Oh.
2013-04-25 01:46:35	jesyspa	L is flip
2013-04-25 01:46:38	jesyspa	R is compose
2013-04-25 01:47:03	tangentstorm	   */1+i.5
2013-04-25 01:47:16	tangentstorm	^in J .. still don't know how to make a function though.
2013-04-25 01:48:03	tangentstorm	you would like joy, jesyspa
2013-04-25 01:48:03	jesyspa	J is something I intend to eventually learn.
2013-04-25 01:48:03	WolfSaint	I was going through J then I realized this is going to get complicated quickly.
2013-04-25 01:48:27	tangentstorm	http://www.kevinalbrecht.com/code/joy-mirror/joy.html

2013-04-25 01:49:05	tangentstorm	there's a guy who hangs out in #retro who is making a J/APL + forth/joy hybrid called saiwa.
2013-04-25 01:49:50	tangentstorm	supposedly he's writing a book on it
2013-04-25 01:50:02	tangentstorm	http://www.13rhinos.de/saiwa.html
2013-04-25 01:50:04	tamper	tangentstorm's url: http://bit.ly/11y2skt - Title: Saiwa - programming language
2013-04-25 01:50:04	tangentstorm	not much to see yet but you can download it.

2013-04-25 01:51:22	tangentstorm	the thing i don't get about J is that once i have an expression working with constants, trying to generalize it into a verb always seems to be a lot of work.
2013-04-25 01:51:36	WolfSaint	I am downloading something right now, and If I open up my browser It will get tired and say it is complete before it is done.
2013-04-25 01:51:36	tangentstorm	because of the way the symbols automatically fuse together :/
2013-04-25 01:52:09	tangentstorm	not really much to see yet on the saiwa page...
2013-04-25 01:52:09	WolfSaint	tangentstorm: Most languages have syntax. J has grammar.
2013-04-25 01:52:22	tangentstorm	yeah :)

2013-07-09 21:33:03	jesyspa	Huh, strange, I'd expect someone that young to feel mildly sick at the thought of code like that.
2013-07-09 21:33:08	Kelet	errors? compile errors or runtime errors?
2013-07-09 21:33:10	jesyspa	Certainly not encouraging it...
2013-07-09 21:33:43	treesquid	3 lines after I ran 'where' using that gdb you showed me
2013-07-09 21:33:48	carefish	jesyspa: well, i have a question for you
2013-07-09 21:33:51	treesquid	they look like memory errors
2013-07-09 21:34:06	Kelet	that is the build up to the error that crashed you
2013-07-09 21:34:08	Kelet	like a history
2013-07-09 21:34:12	Kelet	of what it did up until it crashed
2013-07-09 21:34:17	jesyspa	carefish: Yes?
2013-07-09 21:34:29	Kelet	if you didn't compile with -g or -ggdb3 then it will give you trash lines though
2013-07-09 21:34:40	treesquid	it throws a "segmentation fault (core dumped)" at me
2013-07-09 21:34:43	Kelet	otherwise it should give you a line number etc
2013-07-09 21:34:53	Kelet	pastebin revised code
2013-07-09 21:35:37	treesquid	http://pastebin.com/A1qagDiw
2013-07-09 21:35:54	treesquid	MAX_LENGTH is a constant int, size 255
2013-07-09 21:36:04	Kelet	No
2013-07-09 21:36:26	Kelet	You keep your old code like it was, and you also have nameArray = new char*[5];
2013-07-09 21:36:32	jesyspa	I really doubt you should be assigning to nameArray in here, as you never return it.
2013-07-09 21:36:35	carefish	i've got a couple o' friends, they're much more proficient coders (they've done it since they were like 10, i started about 3 years ago) and they discourage me from using stdlib but i enjoy using it since i can actually spend time on making my games'n'such.. sometimes we get into arguments about whether or not to use libraries at all
2013-07-09 21:36:42	Kelet	treesquid: http://i.imgur.com/S23Rg38.png
2013-07-09 21:36:52	Kelet	Array of char is like the MAX_LENGTH thing
2013-07-09 21:36:58	jesyspa	So it should already be pointing to something sensible.
2013-07-09 21:37:00	Kelet	Array of char * is what you were missing originally
2013-07-09 21:37:13	Kelet	You see how there are 5 array of char *?
2013-07-09 21:37:22	Kelet	You need to allocate that part, and the Array of char part.
2013-07-09 21:37:38	jesyspa	Kelet: Except, you know, you don't.
2013-07-09 21:37:52	jesyspa	You need to allocate each individual line, but not the array as a whole.
2013-07-09 21:39:22	Kelet	Each individual line points to a possibly non-contiguous memory block so there must exist a pointer to it, and to make this pointer in a 2d-array structure you generally have an array of pointers (which must be allocated, somehow)
2013-07-09 21:39:26	treesquid	ohh i think I understand. I believe the Array of char* (left most part) is allocated before it is passed to my bool function, do I just want to allocate the "array of char" part? correct me if i am wrong. Here's the other function that I believe creates the first dimension:
2013-07-09 21:39:30	treesquid	char **createArray(int size)
2013-07-09 21:39:30	treesquid	{
2013-07-09 21:39:31	treesquid	    if(size < 0 || size > 1000)
2013-07-09 21:39:31	treesquid	        return NULL;
2013-07-09 21:39:31	treesquid	    char **array = new char*[size];
2013-07-09 21:39:31	treesquid	    return array;
2013-07-09 21:39:31	treesquid	}
2013-07-09 21:39:37	Kelet	see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/936687/how-do-i-declare-a-2d-array-in-c-using-new

2013-07-09 21:39:54	jesyspa	carefish: Err, right.  There's this concept called "separation of concerns" which happens to be very useful when programming.  You code a single abstraction layer.  Assume the layer under you is done properly.  Provide a good interface to the layer that will come over you.
2013-07-09 21:40:23	carefish	ha!
2013-07-09 21:40:26	Kelet	treesquid, Yeah, that function seems to allocate it
2013-07-09 21:40:33	carefish	nice, thanks :)
2013-07-09 21:40:36	Kelet	So then it's not necessary in the function you're making.
2013-07-09 21:40:55	treesquid	ok so with that function in play, I really only need to allocate the second dimension, right?
2013-07-09 21:41:44	Kelet	Well
2013-07-09 21:41:45	Kelet	maybe
2013-07-09 21:41:48	jesyspa	carefish: What you code yourself and what you use libraries for depends on how thick a layer you take.  At some point, your friends are relying on a lower layer.  Maybe they understand how deep they want to dig, and actually get better results.  Maybe they're just paranoid and end up with slow crap.
2013-07-09 21:42:01	Kelet	Your for loop always allocates 5 strings whereas this function uses size
2013-07-09 21:42:13	Kelet	I would make your for loop use size parameter instead of 5
2013-07-09 21:42:24	Kelet	If size < 5 it could cause a memory access error
2013-07-09 21:42:34	jesyspa	Kelet: Err, no it doesn't.
2013-07-09 21:42:53	treesquid	right, i was using 5 as an arbitrary number when trial and erroring
2013-07-09 21:43:23	jesyspa	Chances are lines 13-18 in the last paste don't dynamically allocate at all.
2013-07-09 21:43:45	carefish	strcpy(nameArray[i],line); from http://pastebin.com/A1qagDiw doesn't assign properly though?
2013-07-09 21:44:40	jesyspa	treesquid: What you seem to want to do is read a line, figure out how long it is, allocate enough room to store it, then copy what you read over into that space.  You can then assign it to nameArray[i].
2013-07-09 21:45:00	jesyspa	At the moment, you can assume that nameArray[i] is garbage for every i in bounds.
2013-07-09 21:45:16	jesyspa	So you shouldn't be using it's value, you should be assigning to it.
2013-07-09 21:45:42	treesquid	Yeah, that's it. Except I don't need to tell how long hte lign is, allocating 255 chars for it regardless of lines actual size.
2013-07-09 21:46:07	jesyspa	If you go that way and allocate 255 regardless of actual size, you don't need the line array.
2013-07-09 21:46:34	jesyspa	You can just keep a char* line which you dynamically allocate before each read.
2013-07-09 21:47:40	jesyspa	Line 12 is unnecessary, by the way; every loop should just allocate room for a line, and read into it.
2013-07-09 21:47:45	jesyspa	Heck, you don't even need strcpy.
2013-07-09 21:48:25	treesquid	line12 was from when I was using eof(), which I guess since Im not scrapping line 12 makes sense
2013-07-09 21:49:37	treesquid	so nameArray[i] = new char*[255]; // allocates space for the next name, ya?
2013-07-09 21:50:05	jesyspa	Won't compile.
2013-07-09 21:50:15	jesyspa	nameArray[i] is a char*, new char*[255] returns a char**
2013-07-09 21:50:32	jesyspa	I think you'll want something to the effect of http://ideone.com/6r66We

2013-07-09 21:51:13	jesyspa	Except that's full of buffer overflow risks and disgusting crap like that.
2013-07-09 21:51:22	jesyspa	And I'm not sure it always correctly null-terminates, which is always fun.
2013-07-09 21:51:27	bolcselo	kelet wanna help me out
2013-07-09 21:51:35	Kelet	what's up?
2013-07-09 21:52:12	treesquid	okay. So just for my own clarity, why don't *'s get used in the function?
2013-07-09 21:52:47	jesyspa	Why are no pointers dereferenced?  They are, nameArray[i] is sugar for *(nameArray + i)
2013-07-09 21:52:47	treesquid	I feel like I had a solid grasp of pointers before, but this assignment and the late night lastnight hittingmy head against it has confused me

2013-07-09 21:54:55	bolcselo	thanks for the offer
2013-07-09 21:54:58	treesquid	you use strcpy, jesyspa has it go right through
2013-07-09 21:55:01	treesquid	same difference?
2013-07-09 21:55:10	Kelet	I'm just using your old code
2013-07-09 21:55:55	Kelet	bolcselo, Winsock and BSD sockets are exactly the same for 95% of 'simple' situations besides a few lines for initialization and includes. Within ~5 lines of code it could work on Windows I'd be guessing.
2013-07-09 21:55:58	jesyspa	treesquid: Mine performs one less read from the file, though I think that shouldn't matter due to the ifstream being local to the functions.
2013-07-09 21:56:26	bolcselo	i would have no way to compile and test it without biugging you a bunch kelet

2013-07-09 21:59:50	treesquid	the i < 5 cuases an error, where as jesyspa's runs, but i think there might be somethign strange going on im looking into it
2013-07-09 22:00:11	treesquid	his runs  because he changed it to size, your code works with size as well

2013-07-09 22:05:15	Kelet	treesquid, That's because the other function initializes the array of pointers to characters as size
2013-07-09 22:05:27	Kelet	You need to change the number in the call to that function.

2013-07-09 22:05:51	jesyspa	treesquid: Well, it makes sense that replacing a meaningful value with an arbitrary one is going to make your program incorrect.  If any value would do, you wouldn't need a value at all.
2013-07-09 22:06:12	jesyspa	Oh hey, at least your teacher uses const int, not #define...
2013-07-09 22:06:15	treesquid	right, I hadn't thought of it that way
2013-07-09 22:07:18	bolcselo	see how its pausing tangentstorm
2013-07-09 22:07:22	@tangentstorm	yes.
2013-07-09 22:07:29	bolcselo	if threading works at all, it still happens this way.
2013-07-09 22:07:51	@tangentstorm	i could see that was going to happen, i just was double checking whether it was what you wanted. :)
2013-07-09 22:07:54	@tangentstorm	i didn't think so
2013-07-09 22:08:15	bolcselo	yeah

2013-07-09 22:08:44	bolcselo	yeah.
2013-07-09 22:08:55	@tangentstorm	it happens in threaded mode because read() also blocks

2013-07-09 22:09:29	@tangentstorm	bolcselo: your irc client doesn't read from stdin.
2013-07-09 22:09:47	bolcselo	does irssi?
2013-07-09 22:09:49	@tangentstorm	or rather it doesn't read through the normal line buffering filter.
2013-07-09 22:10:11	@tangentstorm	it uses "raw mode" to get characters immediately as they are typed.
2013-07-09 22:10:25	@tangentstorm	irssi uses raw mode too.

2013-07-09 22:12:22	@tangentstorm	that line is the while loop.
2013-07-09 22:12:38	treesquid	so looking under util.cc at my copyNames, any idea why it would print out only the last name from input.txt?
2013-07-09 22:12:59	@tangentstorm	you could break this routines into three basic parts: setup(), while not done { step() }; teardown
2013-07-09 22:14:12	@tangentstorm	bolcselo: if you make your sockets non-blocking you can then poll the socket in between keypresses.
