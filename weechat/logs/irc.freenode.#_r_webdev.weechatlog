2013-08-19 17:41:36	@timeshifter	why would he? he'd be in violation of the TOS if he did so
2013-08-19 17:41:49	@timeshifter	which, from my understanding, is why fb won't pay him

2013-08-19 17:46:30	@wdkevin	its already patched
2013-08-19 17:47:05	@scriptor	I guess there might be variations on it that are still vulnerable

2013-08-19 20:30:30	@timeshifter	i know approximately nothing about ec2
2013-08-19 20:30:38	@timeshifter	is it instance-based cloud hosting?
2013-08-19 20:30:38	qwebirc62746	its just a virtual server
2013-08-19 20:30:43	qwebirc62746	yeah
2013-08-19 20:30:45	@timeshifter	ah, what's your os?
2013-08-19 20:30:54	@timeshifter	htaccess requires the isapi rewrite module to run on windows
2013-08-19 20:30:57	qwebirc62746	the one on ec3 is windows 8
2013-08-19 20:30:58	@timeshifter	should be built in to apache
2013-08-19 20:31:01	@timeshifter	there ya go
2013-08-19 20:31:09	@timeshifter	isapi rewrite v2 is what you need
2013-08-19 20:31:22	qwebirc62746	what do i do for that
2013-08-19 20:31:41	@timeshifter	rdp in and use the web platform installer
2013-08-19 20:31:41	qwebirc62746	ive got windows 7 locally and it works on that, the webserver is windows 8 though
2013-08-19 20:31:53	@timeshifter	but
2013-08-19 20:31:55	@timeshifter	why would the server be win8?
2013-08-19 20:31:59	@timeshifter	you mean server 2012?
2013-08-19 20:32:01	qwebirc62746	yes
2013-08-19 20:32:02	@timeshifter	or is it legit win8?

2013-08-19 20:32:13	qwebirc62746	server 2012 i meant, but it looks like win8
2013-08-19 20:32:20	@timeshifter	which is part of why i want nothing to do with it

2013-08-19 20:34:27	@timeshifter	isapi doesn't come from WPI
2013-08-19 20:34:39	@timeshifter	it's a licensed thing, and amazon may already have a solution for it
2013-08-19 20:34:52	@timeshifter	the nice thing about working for an agency is that such are not my concerns
2013-08-19 20:35:02	@timeshifter	"hey, we need to buy this license" "hokay"
2013-08-19 20:35:23	@timeshifter	two years later, i've started to forget what was licensed and what wasn't
