2013-02-19 17:28:25	MJBrune	D:
2013-02-19 17:28:29	MJBrune	I need to start gitting
2013-02-19 17:29:11	MJBrune	style opinion question: do _ALL_ functions need to be in the .cpp file or if there are less than 3 lines can they be in the .h files?
2013-02-19 17:29:57	SneakySnake	It's not really decided by number of lines
2013-02-19 17:30:38	MJBrune	what do you decide it by?
2013-02-19 17:30:48	SneakySnake	I usually put getters, or functions returning simple expressions in header files
2013-02-19 17:30:51	MJBrune	weither its an accessor/mutator or regular?
2013-02-19 17:32:35	SneakySnake	Your compilation will probably be much faster if you don't put large function definitions in header files
2013-02-19 17:33:38	MJBrune	sure I usually keep it down to 3 lines that don't do much computing

2013-02-19 17:40:11	SneakySnake	There is no reason to be afraid
2013-02-19 17:40:45	MJBrune	yes there is.
2013-02-19 17:41:30	MJBrune	once, I put terinary in a for loop and then nested the for loop inside of another for loop that also used terniary.

2013-02-19 19:11:32	Shorefire	Be alive, aparently
2013-02-19 19:11:55	Shorefire	Its not so much the threats that bother me, its the fact that the person backs out when I give them a time and place
2013-02-19 19:14:05	@Calmatory	To void them stay the fuck out from wrong people
2013-02-19 19:14:10	@Calmatory	avoid*

2013-02-19 19:16:05	Shorefire	I offer to settle this over a fair fight, the person backs out, thats what upsets me
2013-02-19 19:16:50	@Calmatory	who on earth would "fight" in the first place :P
2013-02-19 19:16:56	Shorefire	Fights are fun, if they are fair 
2013-02-19 19:17:33	Shorefire	We used to do it for money back in secondary school
2013-02-19 19:17:49	Shorefire	No different from boxing really, just no glove thingys

2013-02-19 19:19:06	@Calmatory	I just see that as something really lame and stupid
2013-02-19 19:19:10	@Calmatory	As if "fighting" fixes a damn thing
2013-02-19 19:19:10	Shorefire	Im going with tile maps, that way a map editor will be fairly easy to make

2013-02-19 19:21:36	Shorefire	Whoever wins rock paper scisors gets the object
2013-02-19 19:21:50	Shorefire	Fairs far
2013-02-19 19:21:55	@Calmatory	Shorefire: How about make this "object" choose it?
2013-02-19 19:21:56	Shorefire	The object is inanimate
2013-02-19 19:22:06	&eXpl0it3r	I call ehrm kindergarden
2013-02-19 19:22:21	Shorefire	Well, say you had a friend, and there is a object that you both want, but cannot decide who gets it
2013-02-19 19:22:34	Shorefire	its just a quicker way of solving things, with more fun, of corse
2013-02-19 19:22:49	Shorefire	Now with a fight, not only does it solve the problem, but the looser isnt going to bother the other person again
2013-02-19 19:23:00	Shorefire	This person is constantly threatening me, if we have a fight and I win, problem solved, if I dont, oh well
2013-02-19 19:23:58	&eXpl0it3r	There's a saying in Swissgerman, that would translate into: The smarter gives up and the donkey stays behind.
2013-02-19 19:24:15	Shorefire	Well, fights to solve things
2013-02-19 19:24:30	Shorefire	Think about it, at the end of mario, he doesnt just have a talk to bowser
2013-02-19 19:24:37	Shorefire	He kicks bowsers ass
2013-02-19 19:24:39	Shorefire	Problem solved
2013-02-19 19:25:10	@Calmatory	I find that quite moronic to say the least, I mean if the other participant lacks the intellec to actually get the problem solved by other means, I by myself rather give up than deal with them
2013-02-19 19:25:10	&eXpl0it3r	^
2013-02-19 19:25:37	Shorefire	I could probably solve it with other means
2013-02-19 19:25:37	Shorefire	But that isnt fun
2013-02-19 19:25:41	Shorefire	Hey dont blame me, grow up with my brother and in my school and you would think the same
2013-02-19 19:25:56	Shorefire	I think this all depends on background
2013-02-19 19:26:05	Silly	This is such a retarded conversation
2013-02-19 19:26:10	Shorefire	So are you.

2013-02-19 19:26:49	@Calmatory	I would think the same that that actually violating other people's right for physical immunity is a way to solve a problem?
2013-02-19 19:26:55	Silly	How did you get all of this
2013-02-19 19:26:55	&eXpl0it3r	We never 'solve' anything over a fight, but by opening our mouth and talk.
2013-02-19 19:26:56	Silly	From Rock Paper Scissors
2013-02-19 19:27:24	Shorefire	What do you do, when the other person doesnt have the maturity or intelect to solve the problem by talking?
2013-02-19 19:27:34	&eXpl0it3r	And by talk I don't mean, "hey you mother fucker, blablablab"
2013-02-19 19:27:38	@Calmatory	Walk away and stay away from dealing with such people
2013-02-19 19:27:38	Shorefire	I am aware
2013-02-19 19:27:39	&eXpl0it3r	I walk away
2013-02-19 19:27:53	Shorefire	Eh, i'd rather not
2013-02-19 19:28:01	&eXpl0it3r	Why?
2013-02-19 19:28:11	Silly	In the situation that Shorefire's I don't think that walking away is an option

2013-02-19 19:28:28	Shorefire	Not sure if sarcasm

2013-02-19 19:29:08	Silly	It'd be different if you were a different person

2013-02-19 19:29:15	Shorefire	Silly, I have a headach, stop making it worse.

2013-02-19 19:29:33	Shorefire	eXpl, no, I last saw it when I was with my dad
2013-02-19 19:29:36	Shorefire	And that was a while ago
2013-02-19 19:29:53	Silly	I was serious up until that last one
2013-02-19 19:29:53	Silly	But
2013-02-19 19:29:53	Silly	Keep on fighting the good fight
2013-02-19 19:30:19	Shorefire	Fighting isnt about being a tuff guy
2013-02-19 19:30:19	Silly	Not about the fighting
2013-02-19 19:30:19	Shorefire	Fighting is personal, I mean in all honesty I have been pushed around my entire life for being 'different'
2013-02-19 19:30:19	Silly	About not backing down
2013-02-19 19:30:44	Silly	Like, fuck
2013-02-19 19:30:53	Shorefire	I got pulled out of school in year 8 because I kept getting beaten up for being 'the kid with the long hair' etc
2013-02-19 19:30:56	&eXpl0it3r	tldr Marty let himself always provoke with "Are you a chicken" and it led always into bad situations, only in the last movie he ignored it and things went good.
2013-02-19 19:31:00	Shorefire	And I have never really had friends to stand up for me, so I stand up for my self
2013-02-19 19:31:23	Silly	I've always been the guy younger / smaller kids called in to deal with bullying / threats etc. etc., and man
2013-02-19 19:31:23	Silly	You can't back down, you really can't
2013-02-19 19:31:23	Shorefire	^
2013-02-19 19:31:25	Silly	And you can't let other people fight your battles for you
2013-02-19 19:31:38	Silly	It's so important that you be true to what you stand for
2013-02-19 19:31:49	Shorefire	I live in a town called south oxhey, its a fucking shit hole
2013-02-19 19:31:50	Silly	Even if it's for the best, sometimes it just isn't worth it to walk away.
2013-02-19 19:31:56	Shorefire	I got beaten up most days for being different, its just something personal
2013-02-19 19:32:33	Shorefire	Btw, homeschooling is awesome
2013-02-19 19:32:33	Shorefire	Since year 8 I was homeschooled, I did nothing all day
2013-02-19 19:33:20	&eXpl0it3r	I guess I'm very lucky to live here in Switzerland than.
2013-02-19 19:33:20	Shorefire	How many back to the future films are there?

2013-02-19 19:33:31	Shorefire	Didnt know there was 3
2013-02-19 19:33:56	&eXpl0it3r	Beatings at school were very rare and got resolved rather quickly.
2013-02-19 19:34:10	Shorefire	They would never get resolved at my school
2013-02-19 19:34:10	&eXpl0it3r	And I've never been in one, then again I was always the big guy.
2013-02-19 19:34:34	Shorefire	They also had the 'whoever hits first is in trouble' policy >_>

2013-02-20 15:28:15	~Tank	Signal handlers are very flexible in the future. You can pass lambdas, free functions, member functions and functors.

2013-02-20 15:36:16	Shorefire	Good, finding downloads for them is a pain 
2013-02-20 15:36:40	Shorefire	It was either this or the 6th plus edition, this looks more promising
2013-02-20 15:36:42	Z_Mass	Dang.. Maybe I'll try and port it if it's not too hard.
2013-02-20 15:37:21	Shorefire	There needs to be a better way to buy things online, like a internet card that you can buy in stores and use on websites
2013-02-20 15:37:43	Shorefire	Like the steam wallet thing
2013-02-20 15:37:57	@Calmatory	Paypal yo.
2013-02-20 15:38:05	@Calmatory	The C++ Primer PLUS is a bad book.
2013-02-20 15:38:08	@Calmatory	Don't bother.
2013-02-20 15:38:19	Shorefire	Yeah I am getting the 5th edition, not the 6th plus edition
2013-02-20 15:38:32	Shorefire	And I cant get paypal, you have to be 18, and I dont even have a bank account yet
2013-02-20 15:38:48	Shorefire	My mother only has a savings account so I cant get her to get one either

2013-02-21 16:57:50	&eXpl0it3r	All written exams
2013-02-21 16:58:30	&eXpl0it3r	And if your average mark is under a 4 (with 1 lowest and 6 highest), you have to repeate all exams

2013-02-24 14:19:57	@danharibo	well
2013-02-24 14:20:03	@danharibo	you look at where the "meat" happens
2013-02-24 14:20:12	@danharibo	and you try to keep the most relavant meat together
2013-02-24 14:20:25	@danharibo	in away that makes it easy to use that meat elsewhere
2013-02-24 14:20:38	+iostream	hm
2013-02-24 14:22:27	_Dbug_	To refactor code, select the most horrible/annoying/frequently used part of the code base, if possible write a small unit test module to validate the existing code, then clean up the code starting by the external API (naming, parameters, etc...) making sure the tests still pass, then when you are happy with the external API only at this moment work on the actual implementation changes.
2013-02-24 14:22:37	_Dbug_	Rince and repeat on the second most annoying code module :)
2013-02-24 14:22:42	<--	jake (jake@rox-7711E6D7.bb.sky.com) has quit (Ping timeout)
2013-02-24 14:22:52	@danharibo	that
2013-02-24 14:22:54	@danharibo	basicly
2013-02-24 14:23:12	@danharibo	I can't really help you
2013-02-24 14:23:12	@danharibo	since I haven't formalized anything I've done
2013-02-24 14:23:14	@danharibo	It's all in brainspeak.
2013-02-24 14:23:30	_Dbug_	Ideally you write the unit test with a code coverage tool that validates that your tests actually go through 100% of the code paths.
2013-02-24 14:23:48	@danharibo	Do you know of any good ones for C++?
2013-02-24 14:23:52	+iostream	Right, but
2013-02-24 14:24:43	_Dbug_	I've been using http://www.bullseye.com on windows, with msvc and UnitTest++. A bit awkward to setup but it works nicely.

2013-02-24 14:25:01	+iostream	But..
2013-02-24 14:25:19	+iostream	How to I turn my ugly code into nice code?
2013-02-24 14:25:27	+iostream	Like..
2013-02-24 14:25:37	_Dbug_	iostream, my idea of Refactoring is not going from Crap to Awesome. The way I do it is to go from state A to state B with B better than A
2013-02-24 14:25:48	+iostream	How do I know what fancy design patterns to use and such?
2013-02-24 14:26:46	_Dbug_	You don't need patterns. You need good code (readable, efficient, easy to maintain, ...) which may or may not be using patterns. Patterns is just a tool.
2013-02-24 14:26:46	+iostream	Yeah
2013-02-24 14:26:46	_Dbug_	If you want a clear example: Find the naked news and delete
2013-02-24 14:26:50	+iostream	But everything is practically a pattern already
2013-02-24 14:27:13	_Dbug_	Replace these by either smart pointers, or classes that initialize/destroy their members (RAII)
2013-02-24 14:27:37	_Dbug_	Make the code "const correct"
2013-02-24 14:28:05	_Dbug_	If you can do these two things, you already have a code base better than 50% of the existing C++ code in the world
2013-02-24 14:28:06	+iostream	Right, yeah
2013-02-24 14:28:11	+iostream	lol :p
2013-02-24 14:28:21	+iostream	I just have almost everything in one file at the moment
2013-02-24 14:28:30	+iostream	and inside main() of course
2013-02-24 14:28:36	@danharibo	sounds good
2013-02-24 14:28:36	_Dbug_	'Remove duplicated code' is also a good one. If you have 3 functions to convert an integer to an hex string, that's two too many
2013-02-24 14:29:07	_Dbug_	Split the code in modules that make sense when it start to get difficult to manage.
2013-02-24 14:29:17	+iostream	Yeah, this part is what I get
2013-02-24 14:29:18	_Dbug_	I don't create my classes and modules until I need them. If I can prototype with everything in one big file, I do it.
2013-02-24 14:29:23	+iostream	My problem is figuring out how to design those modules
2013-02-24 14:29:52	_Dbug_	I call my method 'Sokoban Development'
2013-02-24 14:29:52	+iostream	:D
2013-02-24 14:30:00	_Dbug_	You move the boxes around from one place to another when you need it, and eventually if you don't suck to much they are all at the right place.
2013-02-24 14:30:16	+iostream	Makes sense
2013-02-24 14:30:22	_Dbug_	Also make sure you use a source control software, and that you commit your changes regularly with actual comments on what you did change.
2013-02-24 14:30:40	_Dbug_	IF you stop and start back on the project in 6 month time it's nice to remember where you were
2013-02-24 14:31:23	+iostream	Yeah of course I have version control :p
2013-02-24 14:31:53	_Dbug_	Yeah but do you use it correctly :)

2013-02-24 14:36:33	+iostream	_Dbug_: :o
2013-02-24 14:36:34	+iostream	Sarah: fun
2013-02-24 14:36:58	+iostream	Actually not
2013-02-24 14:37:18	+iostream	:p
2013-02-24 14:37:40	+iostream	_Dbug_: I want to be an Assembly hacker like you!
2013-02-24 14:37:52	_Dbug_	In 68000 and 6502 it'
2013-02-24 14:37:58	_Dbug_	In 68000 and 6502 it's easy and make sense.
2013-02-24 14:38:09	Silly	Why do people like nerdcubed
2013-02-24 14:38:34	@Sarah	Silly, because he's awesome!
2013-02-24 14:38:41	_Dbug_	There's not one compiler that can beat a 6502 or 68000 programmer, even by far. Now on x86... that's an exercize in frustration :)
2013-02-24 14:39:02	@danharibo	x86
2013-02-24 14:39:03	Silly	no
2013-02-24 14:39:04	@danharibo	pls
2013-02-24 14:39:13	@danharibo	I'm glad sony went with x86 for the PS4
2013-02-24 14:39:26	@danharibo	there is some life left in the olde IBM PC yet
2013-02-24 14:39:47	+iostream	Silly: Because he's one of the only youtube gaymers that doesn't sound like he wants to kill himself
2013-02-24 14:40:04	_Dbug_	Most assembler programmer on PC only play on the 256 bytes compos, on larger programs it's really not worth the hassle :)
2013-02-24 14:40:27	Silly	Nerdcubed is annoying as hell to watch
2013-02-24 14:40:45	Silly	dat voice
2013-02-24 14:40:53	+iostream	Is good
2013-02-24 14:41:07	Silly	is annoying
2013-02-24 14:41:14	+iostream	_Dbug_: I tried playing with the linux framebuffer
2013-02-24 14:41:41	+iostream	complex stuff
2013-02-24 14:42:24	_Dbug_	If you want to play with assembler, select a machine with a simple architecture, no caches, direct hardware access.
2013-02-24 14:42:47	+iostream	I know ARM is simple
2013-02-24 14:43:37	Silly	This is a video of iostream: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgJkl2jCA5Y
2013-02-24 14:43:38	Natalie	Title: Drunk Jeff Goldblum - 3 Pizzas - YouTube
2013-02-24 14:43:54	_Dbug_	ARM is probably simpler than x86, but you still have caches and prefetch I guess, makes it difficult to know if your new code is actually faster or slower than what you did before.
2013-02-24 14:44:15	_Dbug_	Assembler on the PS1 and Dreamcast was fun :)
2013-02-24 14:44:38	+iostream	D:
2013-02-24 14:44:51	+iostream	I have a PS1
2013-02-24 14:44:58	+iostream	But don't you have to sign the disks or something
2013-02-24 14:45:36	_Dbug_	Well, I was official ps1 developer, so I had the devkit in my pc
2013-02-24 14:45:40	+iostream	O.o
2013-02-24 14:45:48	+iostream	Share
2013-02-24 14:46:04	_Dbug_	HAD, like from 1995 to 1997

2013-02-24 14:46:15	+iostream	You're old
2013-02-24 14:46:24	@Sarah	Sometimes my father tells me that the people I speak to on IRC are jobless 30 year olds with no life nor future.
2013-02-24 14:46:24	_Dbug_	Plus they were ISA cards, can't think of any machine that can run than anyway :)
2013-02-24 14:46:32	+iostream	Sarah: True
2013-02-24 14:46:37	@Sarah	But hell.
2013-02-24 14:46:44	@danharibo	lol the devkit was an ISA card
2013-02-24 14:46:49	@danharibo	that is pretty funny
2013-02-24 14:47:12	+iostream	wonky
2013-02-24 14:47:24	@Iteem	Sarah: rly?
2013-02-24 14:47:25	 *	_Dbug_ checks something, that was on a 486 DX, was that ISA or VME or something??
2013-02-24 14:47:27	@Iteem	actually only iostream is
2013-02-24 14:47:31	+iostream	what
2013-02-24 14:47:37	+iostream	I hate you too Iteem 
2013-02-24 14:47:39	Silly	As a homeless 60 year old man with no life nor future living on the streets, I have no idea where he got that idea Sarah 
2013-02-24 14:47:42	@Iteem	:D
2013-02-24 14:48:14	@Sarah	Iteem, but then again, my father hates me and everything I do.
2013-02-24 14:48:27	@Sarah	Anyways, does anyone know why SFML can only take 3 keys at a time on the keyboard?
2013-02-24 14:48:40	+iostream	Try other keys
2013-02-24 14:48:42	_Dbug_	Ha yeah, was cards like that: http://img1.picload.org/image/ailwgp/dev1uu.jpg

2013-02-24 14:49:15	@Iteem	that's sad, seriously
2013-02-24 14:49:21	+iostream	Basically that's a PS1?
2013-02-24 14:49:23	_Dbug_	The freaking cards were so long that they did not fit in all our machines :)
2013-02-24 14:49:28	@Iteem	and the thing with 3 keys is not a problem of sfml
2013-02-24 14:49:37	@Iteem	it's a problem of your keyboard
2013-02-24 14:49:43	@Sarah	Oh
2013-02-24 14:49:55	@Sarah	Damn
2013-02-24 14:49:55	@Sarah	This is my favorite keyboard of all time.
2013-02-24 14:49:57	_Dbug_	The cool thing is that there was no memory protection, so we could 'poke' directly in the card's memory, so our tools could directly write meshes and move camera directly from the pc
2013-02-24 14:50:15	+iostream	Sarah: pics
2013-02-24 14:50:17	+iostream	_Dbug_: awesome
2013-02-24 14:50:21	@danharibo	_Dbug_: sounds cool
2013-02-24 14:51:25	 *	_Dbug_ feels like 'grand dad telling stories about the war'

2013-02-24 14:52:11	@danharibo	shit's cray
2013-02-24 14:52:22	_Dbug_	Sarah, tell you father that you also speak on IRC with 40+ people who work (for the "no life nor future" I let you decide)
2013-02-24 14:52:35	@Sarah	_Dbug_, haha
2013-02-24 14:52:38	@Sarah	But my point is
2013-02-24 14:52:43	Silly	stab him and run away to join the circus then Sarah 
2013-02-24 14:52:47	Silly	Obviously your only option.

2013-02-24 14:52:58	@Sarah	Zack works for Linkedin, my father's a huge fan of that.
2013-02-24 14:52:59	_Dbug_	danharibo, For that I'm using a system where objects have properties and they are read/written through a text conversion.
2013-02-24 14:53:00	+iostream	but then she wouldn't be in Kansas anymore
2013-02-24 14:53:17	+iostream	Who's Zack? What's linkedin?
2013-02-24 14:53:36	Silly	What?

2013-02-24 15:18:33	Silly	Assume you have the manpower and resources for it
2013-02-24 15:18:45	Silly	Again assume that the factory is completely functional from all standpoints
2013-02-24 15:18:58	Silly	And then make up the expertise to use the complicated machines on the spot
2013-02-24 15:19:04	Silly	It aint that easy.

2013-02-24 15:22:43	+iostream	So you go insane after 20 minutes instead
2013-02-24 15:22:50	_Dbug_	Most outages in my area are in the 5-10 minutes range
2013-02-24 15:22:55	+iostream	Well I'm on a laptop
2013-02-24 15:23:10	+iostream	But a computer without Internet is worthless!!
2013-02-24 15:24:01	_Dbug_	I guess the fiber installation in my building must be on UPS as well becasue even when all the power is out in the whole area I still have internet working (and yes my router is on the UPS as well)
2013-02-24 15:24:40	+iostream	hax
2013-02-24 15:24:40	@danharibo	nice
2013-02-24 15:24:46	+iostream	Also let's say I have this piece of code:
2013-02-24 15:24:48	+iostream	player.getSprite()->setTexture(*ResourceManager::aquireTexture("../res/gubbeidle.png"), true);
2013-02-24 15:25:02	+iostream	If I were to stick this into the Player object itself, it would now depend on the ResourceManager
2013-02-24 15:25:10	+iostream	Which I guess is ugly?
2013-02-24 15:25:14	_Dbug_	I've been considering installing solar panels where I live, but I'm still not sure how crappy that would be as far in the north.
2013-02-24 15:26:10	_Dbug_	iostream, depends
2013-02-24 15:26:10	MJBrune	I think if you really want to stockpile something. Batteries.
2013-02-24 15:26:27	MJBrune	Batteries and bullets
2013-02-24 15:26:28	+iostream	Bullets?
2013-02-24 15:26:29	_Dbug_	In my designs there's a cut off point where something is considered as mandatory and global to the system. In my case a resource manager, memory manager, network system, could be considered as global resources that everything can use

2013-02-24 15:28:04	MJBrune	iostream: lol
2013-02-24 15:28:11	_Dbug_	iostream, there's some programmers who say that singleton are evils, that globals are evils, that many things like that are evil.
2013-02-24 15:28:13	Silly	You can make your own from raw materials and an 800$ press pretty easily

2013-02-24 15:28:28	_Dbug_	I think that if it's clearly documented, with a good API, it allows the rest of the code to be clean and simple.
2013-02-24 15:28:32	MJBrune	Silly: yes but don't those require the caps on the back that you have to buy?
2013-02-24 15:28:46	+iostream	_Dbug_: Yeah
2013-02-24 15:29:14	+iostream	_Dbug_: Not that I'm anywhere close to this yet, but I'm still thinking about "What if I want to set up a headless game server?"
2013-02-24 15:29:20	Silly	no, MJBrune 
2013-02-24 15:29:22	MJBrune	yeah I don't see why the renderwindow in sfml cant be global
2013-02-24 15:29:29	MJBrune	Silly: then that would be perfect
2013-02-24 15:29:31	+iostream	Then I don't want graphic stuff going on in my generic objects
2013-02-24 15:30:06	_Dbug_	Well, a way to do that is to have two levels of object derivation and some factories
2013-02-24 15:30:24	_Dbug_	Say that each object exist in 'base', 'server' and 'client' version
2013-02-24 15:30:49	_Dbug_	you can derive server from base, derive client from base, and get the factory to return the correct type of object depending if you are running in server or client mode
2013-02-24 15:30:53	MJBrune	so anyways, as for society collapse. Almost impossible for that to happen
2013-02-24 15:30:54	Silly	I think depending on where I was during the apocalypse I'd rather have a bow though
2013-02-24 15:30:56	Silly	Gun are loud

2013-02-24 15:31:11	+iostream	_Dbug_: Hm, interesting
2013-02-24 15:31:31	MJBrune	Silly: sure but bows take a more energy to use and more time to shoot.
2013-02-24 15:31:41	_Dbug_	iostream, if your objects are virtual, you can then have the base interface used in all the rest of the code and just specialize the behavior in the derived code
2013-02-24 15:31:44	MJBrune	I'd rather have a knife and a gun.
2013-02-24 15:31:49	Silly	Of course you can still carry a gun with you
2013-02-24 15:31:52	Silly	As well as a knife
2013-02-24 15:32:07	Silly	But bows have the benefit of accuracy, recoverability, and silence
2013-02-24 15:32:22	MJBrune	eh bows aren't great, they aren't very accurate if you haven't used them your entire life
2013-02-24 15:32:22	@danharibo	you can't though
2013-02-24 15:32:23	Silly	Easier to aim a bow than a gun with shaky hands
2013-02-24 15:32:26	+iostream	and you can make arrows with sticks and stones
2013-02-24 15:32:27	@danharibo	the bow takes up your gun slot.
2013-02-24 15:32:41	MJBrune	guns you can pick up and hit a guy from 20 feet
2013-02-24 15:32:48	_Dbug_	If all you have to survive is a bow, trust me you will learn to be accurate very fast :D
2013-02-24 15:32:52	Silly	haha
2013-02-24 15:32:54	Silly	hahaha
2013-02-24 15:33:01	MJBrune	bows, you simply cant do that without putting a few weeks training in
2013-02-24 15:33:18	Silly	It isn't really all that hard
2013-02-24 15:33:21	MJBrune	I've shot both a bow and a gun without having any experience recently.
2013-02-24 15:33:21	Silly	If you can aim with a gun you can aim with a bow
2013-02-24 15:33:33	_Dbug_	Actually no
2013-02-24 15:33:51	_Dbug_	It's easy with the bow to hurt yourself with the rope against your forearm, which will throw the arrow totally out of the right course
2013-02-24 15:34:03	+iostream	Also, a protip

2013-02-24 17:29:16	Brodal	my 2d topdown character is moving choppy as hell
2013-02-24 17:30:51	MJBrune	you could send less data.

2013-02-24 17:32:28	@danharibo	that is like 20 bytes
2013-02-24 17:32:28	Brodal	it seems that the longer i keep moving without stopping the more out of sync the position gets and the choppier it gets, the character jumps back and forth between 2 positions while moving
2013-02-24 17:32:58	MJBrune	send less data. Don't send it every time you render.
2013-02-24 17:33:28	MJBrune	20*30 frames a second (at least)
2013-02-24 17:33:31	MJBrune	= bytes you are probably sending a second.
2013-02-24 17:33:45	Brodal	aha, how often should one send then?
2013-02-24 17:33:52	Brodal	as it is now im sending at 60 fps :o
2013-02-24 17:34:12	MJBrune	so 1.2 KB/s
2013-02-24 17:35:01	Brodal	should i instad just sum up every movement made over a couple of frames while still moving as usual on the client
2013-02-24 17:35:19	Brodal	and then send that whole summed up movement?
2013-02-24 17:35:46	MJBrune	thats one way sure
2013-02-24 17:35:46	MJBrune	also prediction is good
2013-02-24 17:35:51	Brodal	yeah thats what i want to do
2013-02-24 17:35:53	Brodal	how does that work?
2013-02-24 17:36:19	MJBrune	which would be basically waht you are doing (with the summing) but on the other clients side
2013-02-24 17:36:46	Brodal	aha
2013-02-24 17:36:46	MJBrune	taking the next few frames and going Okay hes heading this way to keep him going this way
2013-02-24 17:37:33	Brodal	aha ok
2013-02-24 17:37:50	Brodal	what im doing now is that im sending the position i want to move to, to the host, which validates it and sends it back
2013-02-24 17:37:58	Brodal	and that is causing me alot of choppy movement
2013-02-24 17:38:59	Brodal	so to fix that i just send my position fewer times?
2013-02-24 17:39:09	Brodal	and keep moving on my client, and if the positions dont match when ive sent the whole sum of the movement then i correct my position?
2013-02-24 17:41:24	MJBrune	yes
2013-02-24 17:41:24	MJBrune	also how are you sending them?
2013-02-24 17:41:26	Brodal	packets, udp
2013-02-24 17:41:27	MJBrune	TCP?
2013-02-24 17:41:29	Brodal	non blocking
2013-02-24 17:41:39	MJBrune	ahh
2013-02-24 17:41:59	MJBrune	maybe every X amount of time send 1 TCP packet to make sure everything is synced
2013-02-24 17:42:02	MJBrune	10-40 seconds?
2013-02-24 17:42:14	Brodal	aha ok :)
2013-02-24 17:42:17	Brodal	will try that!
2013-02-24 17:42:40	Brodal	how about udp packages, how often should they be sent?

2013-02-24 17:43:27	MJBrune	hmm
2013-02-24 17:45:40	MJBrune	Maybe every second. depending on how fast paced the game is.
2013-02-24 17:45:53	MJBrune	every 30 frames or such
2013-02-24 17:46:32	Brodal	aha ok
2013-02-24 17:47:02	Brodal	its topdown with a fighting system like.. hmm... secret of mana and other such snes rpgs
2013-02-24 17:47:53	@danharibo	your "ticks" should not be connected to the framerate
2013-02-24 17:48:02	MJBrune	that too
2013-02-24 17:48:16	@danharibo	if your server runs at 20hz, then you send updates at 20hz
2013-02-24 17:48:33	MJBrune	but I figured it's already probably really intergrated into his game
2013-02-24 17:49:13	Brodal	how would i know what pace my server runs at?
2013-02-24 17:50:07	MJBrune	how many ticks a second
2013-02-24 17:50:14	Brodal	aha
2013-02-24 17:50:52	Brodal	whats the difference between ticks and fps when it comes to the speed the server runs at?
2013-02-24 17:51:08	MJBrune	ticks are what update the game (position and etc)
2013-02-24 17:51:28	MJBrune	its the calculations side of things
2013-02-24 17:51:37	MJBrune	fps is drawing the window
2013-02-24 17:51:52	Brodal	aha, my server actually doesnt do the calculations
2013-02-24 17:51:53	Brodal	it forwards the messages between clients
2013-02-24 17:52:07	Brodal	the first client that logs in becomes the host and takes over simulation of the world
2013-02-24 17:52:29	MJBrune	the server is tasked with syncing the clients.
2013-02-24 17:53:13	Brodal	as it is now it just runs at however the fast it can >_<
2013-02-24 17:53:13	Sze	move it to the server else the host as much less lag then everybody else
2013-02-24 17:53:29	Brodal	Sze was gonna fix that by sending messages to every client first
2013-02-24 17:53:31	Brodal	to even out the latency
2013-02-24 17:53:53	Brodal	so that everyone has the same distance to send their shit
2013-02-24 17:54:29	Brodal	so the host doesn't instantly move himself, he does the calculations sends it out and moves when it comes back to him again
2013-02-24 17:54:39	Brodal	so that he doesn't get a huge advantage over everyone else

2013-02-24 17:55:14	Sze	Brodal: you can't even out the latency, if you do that it slows down others unneccessarily at least unless you auto kick people with too high ping
2013-02-24 17:55:24	Brodal	Sze: there are alot of games that do it this way?
2013-02-24 17:55:24	Brodal	when it cames to latency
2013-02-24 17:55:54	Brodal	comes*
2013-02-24 17:55:54	Sze	Brodal: what was?
2013-02-24 17:55:54	Sze	way
2013-02-24 17:55:54	Brodal	pretty sure every fps game kicks people with too high ping
2013-02-24 17:56:09	MJBrune	Brodal: ... no?
2013-02-24 17:56:30	MJBrune	all valve games by default don't kick people with high pings
2013-02-24 17:56:52	MJBrune	and they have pretty decent net code
2013-02-24 17:57:30	Brodal	still, games do even out latency
2013-02-24 17:58:37	Sze	some might, or some admins might, but also they use dedicated servers which dictate whats true, even when somebody hosts the game that one usually starts a server under the hood, instead of being a server-ly client

2013-02-24 17:59:53	Brodal	the way im doing it now the messages still has to be sent to the server first before movement happens, even if it is the host moving
2013-02-24 18:00:31	Brodal	so latency wise that should pretty much give the same result as starting a server on the side for everything?
2013-02-24 18:01:16	Brodal	or am i very wrong? >_<
2013-02-24 18:05:46	Sze	disclaimer: I don't have practical experience, so I only can argue from a theoretic perspective, but when you send the server stuff so that he relays that to the other clients, then that also means that the server has collect the info from the clients, send it to you then you can do the simulation and the server sends it back to the other clients
2013-02-24 18:06:49	Sze	but if you just send the server information how your client moves then the server can do its simulation with all the data it has from all the clients and send its result back to all the clients
2013-02-24 18:07:12	Sze	with the former you have more points where there is a middle man, thus more lag

2013-02-25 13:26:54	@Sarah	It didn't work.
2013-02-25 13:27:13	@Sarah	So, how do I resize a window while keeping the stuff I'm rendering the same size?
2013-02-25 13:27:36	+iostream	Did you do renderwindow.setsize() or something?
2013-02-25 13:27:56	@Sarah	Yeah
2013-02-25 13:27:59	+iostream	Don't
2013-02-25 13:28:02	@Sarah	D:
2013-02-25 13:28:07	@Sarah	What do I do?
2013-02-25 13:28:25	+iostream	When the Resized event is pushed, the renderwindow has already been resized
2013-02-25 13:28:31	@Sarah	I see.
2013-02-25 13:28:41	+iostream	And when calling renderwindow.setsize, you push yet ANOTHER Resized event
2013-02-25 13:28:50	+iostream	Which will end up looping forever and eventually implode
2013-02-25 13:29:01	+iostream	I guess
2013-02-25 13:29:07	+iostream	Also you have to change the View
2013-02-25 13:29:38	+iostream	There is always a View, whether or not you create one
2013-02-25 13:29:39	@Sarah	So I have to use an std::view?
2013-02-25 13:29:46	+iostream	renderwindow.getDefaultView()
2013-02-25 13:29:47	@Sarah	sf::View*
2013-02-25 13:29:50	@Sarah	Oic
2013-02-25 13:30:07	+iostream	You can get that view, or create a new one, or whatever - just set it to the correct new size
2013-02-25 13:30:12	+iostream	SFML won't do it for you
2013-02-25 13:30:19	+iostream	And then renderwindow.setView() to update
2013-02-25 13:30:48	+iostream	Also don't trust anything I'm saying because I have no idea what I'm talking about

2013-02-25 16:03:28	@Sarah	iostream, because.
2013-02-25 16:03:28	@Sarah	:U
2013-02-25 16:03:43	+iostream	Do you think view == layer?

2013-02-25 16:04:13	+iostream	"view" is an object that carries transformation data
2013-02-25 16:04:14	~Tank	Entities is a std::vector btw.
2013-02-25 16:04:35	~Tank	You just killed the benefit of sequential containers.
2013-02-25 16:04:35	~Tank	:P
2013-02-25 16:04:35	+iostream	It transform all the vertices drawn with it

2013-02-25 16:05:06	+iostream	Yeah, 64 bit? that's silly
2013-02-25 16:05:08	+iostream	Use __uint128_t like a real man

2013-02-25 16:06:24	+iostream	Why did he kill the benefit of container
2013-02-25 16:06:25	+iostream	or how
2013-02-25 16:06:52	~Tank	Because he stores pointers in the vector that point to memory which is allocated all over the place.
2013-02-25 16:07:09	MJBrune	so community, thats a good tv show huh?
2013-02-25 16:07:09	+iostream	MJBrune: no
2013-02-25 16:07:13	+iostream	Tank: right
2013-02-25 16:07:52	+iostream	Tank: And a smart pointer will allocate everything sequentially?
2013-02-25 16:07:52	~Tank	Double indirection, cache fucks.
2013-02-25 16:07:58	~Tank	No, you store the data itself.
2013-02-25 16:08:06	~Tank	std::vector<int> instead of <int*>.
2013-02-25 16:08:07	+Calmatory	iostream: should have just placed the objects into the vector
2013-02-25 16:08:37	+iostream	uhm

2013-02-25 16:09:09	~Tank	*Always*?
2013-02-25 16:09:16	~Tank	I mean, there are for sure situations when you want to do that.
2013-02-25 16:09:18	~Tank	But not as a general rule.
2013-02-25 16:09:39	+iostream	not sure
2013-02-25 16:09:39	@Sarah	iostream, I still can't get the bullets to fire from the center of the player's view.
2013-02-25 16:09:41	~Tank	A std::vector with smart pointers is still better than a std::list.
2013-02-25 16:09:54	~Tank	std::list is pure shit anyway, btw.

2013-02-25 16:10:48	+iostream	sucks
2013-02-25 16:10:53	@Iteem	why is std::list pure shit?
2013-02-25 16:11:21	~Tank	Slow, memory waster.
2013-02-25 16:11:33	~Tank	Yeah yeah, there are situations blah blah.
2013-02-25 16:11:34	@Iteem	lol
2013-02-25 16:11:38	Matty	new delete over smart pointers!
2013-02-25 16:11:45	@Sarah	Tank, help ne with sf::View.
2013-02-25 16:11:53	@Sarah	me*
2013-02-25 16:12:04	~Tank	What's up with it?
2013-02-25 16:12:05	~Tank	Matty: No.
2013-02-25 16:12:18	Matty	<3
2013-02-25 16:12:35	@Sarah	I can't get my bullets to fire from the same place as the center of my sf::View (which isn't the same view as the bullets are rendered to).
2013-02-25 16:13:03	@Sarah	I'm moving the sf::View that contains the player.
2013-02-25 16:13:03	~Tank	Why is that dependant on views at all?
2013-02-25 16:13:03	~Tank	Bullets have a position, done.
2013-02-25 16:13:09	@Sarah	Because it worked before I wanted to use views.
2013-02-25 16:13:15	@Iteem	I think it's not wrong to store bullets in a list ;P
2013-02-25 16:13:34	@Sarah	And since it's not working anymore, it must be because I'm using sf::View.
2013-02-25 16:13:39	~Tank	Iteem: Yes, it's not wrong, but it's not really nice.
2013-02-25 16:13:52	~Tank	Sarah: Why are you using multiple views for rendering the same scene?
2013-02-25 16:14:02	@Iteem	what would you use in this case?
2013-02-25 16:14:04	@Iteem	vector?
2013-02-25 16:14:35	~Tank	Are we talking about particles?
2013-02-25 16:14:37	~Tank	I.e. lots and lots of stuff?
2013-02-25 16:15:19	~Tank	I think it depends on the implementation of the rendering, too. If I need to iterate the memory often, I'd try to avoid list.
2013-02-25 16:15:37	~Tank	The cost of resizing the vector/moving memory is not as high as many think it is.
2013-02-25 16:16:39	@Iteem	if many bullets or whatever are destroyed it can be very expensive
2013-02-25 16:16:41	@Sarah	Tank, I'm not. Kind of.
2013-02-25 16:16:52	@Sarah	I want the player to be rendered in one view.
2013-02-25 16:17:03	@Sarah	So that I can move that view around the world
2013-02-25 16:17:08	@Sarah	Instead of moving the whole world around the player.
2013-02-25 16:17:12	~Tank	But both the player and the bullets are in one world, Sarah.
2013-02-25 16:17:21	~Tank	It doesn't make sense to use multiple vies.
2013-02-25 16:17:22	~Tank	+w
2013-02-25 16:17:41	+Calmatory	The real way is to use a ring buffer for things which get created/destroyed alot
2013-02-25 16:17:41	~Tank	^
2013-02-25 16:18:18	@Iteem	doesn't help if they are destoryed in the middle of the ring buffer ;)
2013-02-25 16:18:29	Matty	i used a simple vector of 20,000 sf::sprites for my particle system, and its beautiful http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdmAdtQe_oc
2013-02-25 16:18:29	Natalie	Title: C++ Particle Engine - SFML/OpenGL - YouTube
2013-02-25 16:18:43	Matty	took me 5 hours
2013-02-25 16:19:06	+Calmatory	Iteem: the point is that existing instances get re-used
2013-02-25 16:19:06	~Tank	Iteem: There are a lot of ways to improve performance with vectors or ring buffers.
2013-02-25 16:19:17	@danharibo	install gentoo for instance
2013-02-25 16:19:23	~Tank	But there are 0 ways of making a list faster.
2013-02-25 16:19:32	Matty	Tank, I use an int called ParticleIterator which moves through the vector of 20,000
2013-02-25 16:19:38	~Tank	Page faults all over the place.
2013-02-25 16:19:38	Matty	calling on a particle whe needed
2013-02-25 16:19:38	~Tank	:P
2013-02-25 16:19:42	Matty	then ++
2013-02-25 16:20:25	@Sarah	Tank, then how should I do this?
2013-02-25 16:20:31	~Tank	Sarah: Use one view.
2013-02-25 16:20:37	@Iteem	yy, doesn't make sense to optmise this shit for less than 1000 bullets anyway
2013-02-25 16:20:50	~Tank	Sarah: Hook its center to the player position.
2013-02-25 16:20:55	~Tank	And move the player too, of course.
2013-02-25 16:21:11	~Tank	Iteem: Think big. :P
2013-02-25 16:22:13	@Sarah	Tank, okay, then what do I render the rest of the world to?
2013-02-25 16:22:21	+iostream	the same view
2013-02-25 16:22:23	~Tank	Same

2013-02-25 16:23:07	@Sarah	iostream, Tank: but that requires me to move the whole world around the player.
2013-02-25 16:23:21	~Tank	Iteem: Did you seriously think that Boost doesn't have something for that? :P
2013-02-25 16:23:21	@Iteem	no :D
2013-02-25 16:23:21	~Tank	Sarah: No.
2013-02-25 16:23:28	~Tank	Sarah: Your objects have their positions.
2013-02-25 16:23:35	~Tank	You just render them where they are.
2013-02-25 16:23:50	@Iteem	since boost has a bigint/float lib it really has everything I can think of atm
2013-02-25 16:23:53	~Tank	You only move the view, the camera.
2013-02-25 16:24:33	+iostream	Sarah: By moving the view/camera, the world will APPEAR to move
2013-02-25 16:24:35	@Sarah	Tank: so I render the world to the camera?
2013-02-25 16:24:48	~Tank	You render the world. Nothing more.

2013-02-25 16:51:55	Auldrin	Turns out the reason it's not reaching the pathing, is that it's not even reaching the AI at all. It's somehow failing to get into a for loop.

2013-02-25 17:00:29	--	Sven is now known as RESIDENT-UHLIG
2013-02-25 17:01:05	Auldrin	Is refusing to use a namespace some new and exciting form of elitism, or are you using a lot of std?
2013-02-25 17:01:40	@Sarah	I think it's better practice not to use a namespace.
2013-02-25 17:01:50	@Sarah	Well
2013-02-25 17:01:54	@Sarah	Not to use "using namespace"
2013-02-25 17:02:55	Auldrin	Well yeah, that's what I meant of course. Fair enough, I just see it as extra unwanted clutter.
2013-02-25 17:03:27	_Dbug_	namespaces are good. "using namespace bla" is bad
2013-02-25 17:03:33	@Sarah	^
2013-02-25 17:03:40	_Dbug_	"using namespace bla" in a header file is worse
2013-02-25 17:04:05	@Sarah	'tis what i think, but I am in no position to say what is good or bad in programming. :p
2013-02-25 17:04:10	_Dbug_	Now local usage of "using" in a function can be a good idea here and there with some libraries
2013-02-25 17:04:17	@danharibo	yes
2013-02-25 17:04:22	@danharibo	do not clutter the global names space
2013-02-25 17:04:37	_Dbug_	Like some of the boost asio stuff is just riduclous
2013-02-25 17:05:12	_Dbug_	boost::asio::whatever::something::somethingelse.dosomething(bost::bla::bla::beurhgglsdfldsf)
2013-02-25 17:05:24	Rosme	"using namespace" in a header is bad because it expose the header to global namespace right? Therefore possible conflict, as well as making things less clear from where they come from.
2013-02-25 17:06:45	_Dbug_	rosme: it also increases the risks of impossible to understand name collisions because in C++ unfortunatelly it gets fast to the point when any cpp file includes hundreds of h files indirectly
2013-02-25 17:07:22	_Dbug_	and when one of the header file has a 'using' on something it gets easy to collide
2013-02-25 17:07:26	Rosme	Yeah, that was I meant by conflict. Thanks.
2013-02-25 17:09:13	@Iteem	boost spirit's namespaces are a pain too
2013-02-25 17:09:24	@Iteem	boost::spirit::qi::_1
2013-02-25 17:09:49	_Dbug_	now, with 'auto' a lot of these verbosity problem disappear
2013-02-25 17:10:12	_Dbug_	unfortunately auto is not yet available on all compilers/code bases :'(
2013-02-25 17:10:12	 *	_Dbug_ cries
2013-02-25 17:10:24	Rosme	yeah, but I found a code that abused auto, and in the end, you just didn't know what type was what
2013-02-25 17:10:51	_Dbug_	I use auto 90% on iterators
2013-02-25 17:11:12	Rosme	So I guess, using auto is ok, but abusing it makes just the code a big bloat of anything. But for iterators, it's just plain marvelous
2013-02-25 17:11:29	_Dbug_	You just described C++
2013-02-25 17:13:01	_Dbug_	You get a lot of tools/features, most of them has to be used with moderation. Like chocolate and whipped cream
2013-02-25 17:13:01	@Sarah	No
2013-02-25 17:13:01	@Sarah	Whipped cream shouldn't be used at all.
2013-02-25 17:13:01	@Sarah	Chocolate should be used everywhere.
2013-02-25 17:13:01	Sze	Sarah: your "if(mainClock.getElapsedTime().asMilliseconds() > 16)" is Silly because you never reset the clock, so that is always true after the first 16 milliseconds and maybe overflow
2013-02-25 17:13:01	Rosme	I don't agree with that, Whipped cream is so good
2013-02-25 17:13:01	_Dbug_	Replace 'whipped cream' by 'goto' and you get the poiint
2013-02-25 17:13:02	@Sarah	Sze, already fixed that a long time ago.
2013-02-25 17:13:08	@Sarah	_Dbug_, aah, yeah
2013-02-25 17:13:14	@Sarah	goto should rarely be used either.
2013-02-25 17:13:31	@Sarah	But it has its uses.
2013-02-25 17:13:46	Rosme	I actually never came to use goto. Always had a better solution
2013-02-25 17:13:46	_Dbug_	there are places where goto are justifiable, but yeah in general they are not the best choice
2013-02-25 17:14:19	_Dbug_	In C the only places I used goto was on a memory card and cd rom handling on playstation 1
2013-02-25 17:14:29	Auldrin	 customers.push_back(); //this always runs
2013-02-25 17:14:29	Auldrin	 for (int i = 0; i < customers.size(); i++)
2013-02-25 17:14:29	Auldrin	   {} //this never runs, and I have given up on life as a result
2013-02-25 17:14:52	_Dbug_	There was so many steps to do, with so many error conditions, that my first version had so many loops and ifs that it was absolutely unreadable and would not fit on the screen
2013-02-25 17:15:13	@Sarah	Auldrin, std::cout<<customers.size();
2013-02-25 17:15:13	Rosme	But then again, I never programmed anything really big except personnal project to learn, or for school.  No wonder I never came across a case where I need goto

2013-02-25 17:16:32	_Dbug_	school projects tend to assume a perfect world where there's always enough memory, enough disc space, the cd rom/sdcard never get ejected while the program works, all the config files are there and not modified by the user, etc...
2013-02-25 17:18:01	Rosme	Yep! I don't really like that, but what can I really do about it? I just do what I'm asked.

2013-02-25 17:18:37	Auldrin	Apparently it's being created then destroyed. I haven't intentionally added anything which would destroy it, so that's promising.
2013-02-25 17:18:56	_Dbug_	What you can do is to add coments (single liners) here and there in the code to indicate for error cases worth checking in a complete application. Helps you remembering that, and shops the teachers you are aware of it
2013-02-25 17:21:53	Rosme	That's a good idea actually. Never thought of that. Never been much interested by the projects we had to do, so I only did the minimum. Thanks for the tips.
2013-02-25 17:22:50	_Dbug_	The point of univerisity is part to try to get a diploma, part trying to get a maximum of this mandatory time wasted there :) Try to find ways to make it useful.
2013-02-25 17:23:58	Rosme	Will Do!
2013-02-25 17:24:12	_Dbug_	Also in many schools you can negociate about the assignments
2013-02-25 17:25:09	Rosme	Not in mine. The only thing I was able to chose was my final assignement. Other than that, it's follow the direction, otherwise you got a 0
2013-02-25 17:25:10	_Dbug_	Most of my co-students did the standard shit of the time (learn how to program a serial port, do some reporting program, whatever...) but another team and myself aksed if we could instead present graphical projects
2013-02-25 17:25:56	Rosme	That's nice. Wish I could do something like that
2013-02-25 17:26:10	_Dbug_	Or sometimes you can negociate details: When everybody had to use 8086 assembly, I was authorized to use 80286 instruction set (but I had to demonstrate I needed them)
2013-02-25 17:27:05	_Dbug_	(and yes that was some time ago :p but I believe teachers are flexible when approached calmly in an adult way)
2013-02-25 17:28:01	Rosme	Some are, but I guess I got the wrong one. Most of my teachers believe they are almost "god allmighty" and so all they say is right, and if you say/do otherwise, you're wrong.
2013-02-25 17:28:46	_Dbug_	Well, by definition they are wrong. Nobody is always right, and even if you were right yesterday you are possibly wrong today anyway :)
2013-02-25 17:29:06	_Dbug_	Most teachers only teach. These one are even 'more wrong'
2013-02-25 17:29:31	_Dbug_	The few teachers that keeps track of decent knowledge levels are the one that have a side job in the industry
2013-02-25 17:30:20	Rosme	Yeah well, I just find myself some other projects to do, I read, and try to learn new stuff. From what I can read on the internet, I know that what I'm being thought is not at all the representation in the world. So I find myself challenges to test myself, for when I'll be out there, I'll be more prepared.

2013-02-25 17:31:27	_Dbug_	The ones that programmed before are generally ok
2013-02-25 17:34:44	Rosme	I'm not really suprised. School give you the basics of where you're supposed to look to get knowledge. Afterwards, it's your job(as a student) to get more information and look forward to that knowledge. That's my opinion.
2013-02-25 17:34:46	-->	MJBrune (james@rox-E0366EA1.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #sfml
2013-02-25 17:35:08	Rosme	I might be wrong with that opinion, but I don't think school should teach you everything. Should give you tips on how to get better and help you get better.
2013-02-25 17:39:02	Sze	what annoys me with schools is, that they often assume certain level (often pretty high) level of being teached, instead of being free to teach yourself. And that you often can't influence what you have to learn, can be negative aswell, depending on whether you are right with not wanting to be bothered with it, or you really "should" know it.
2013-02-25 17:41:45	_Dbug_	The problem is that they have to give a 'level of certification' so they can give you this pointless piece of paper that only uses at going through selection in the job search process
2013-02-25 17:42:13	_Dbug_	If the studies are not 'standardized' and 'formated' there's no way this diploma means anything at all.
2013-02-25 17:43:03	Rosme	Yeah I get what you mean by that. Every school teachs their way, and their language, and all, and they think it's the best.
2013-02-25 17:45:49	Sze	I would prefer if programming related certification would be switched to code contribution to free software, but I guess that would require a higher amount of actually qualified people as application-reviewers
2013-02-25 17:46:07	Sze	I mean job-applications
2013-02-25 17:46:40	Rosme	As a student, we are invited to look at the google summer of code. We are also invited to participate if we have the knowledge. But in most case, student doesn't care(which is sad), and teachers doesn't want to help us in that move(which is even more sad).
2013-02-25 17:47:40	_Dbug_	Sze, when I review job candidates (resumes/cover letters) I tend to do a quick selection based first on the fact that cover letter is generic or not. If it's generic and not related to the job, the resume goes in 'column B'
2013-02-25 17:48:08	_Dbug_	The in the resumes I check I look at the ones that indicate personal projects and websites
2013-02-25 17:48:19	_Dbug_	These goes in the first column
2013-02-25 17:48:51	Rosme	Well, that was an interesting discussion, but I have stuff to do! See ya!

2013-02-25 17:49:37	Sze	hehe
2013-02-25 17:50:09	_Dbug_	Basically I'm searching first for people who can work in a team, and are interested by the job.
2013-02-25 17:50:34	_Dbug_	The formal education comes last in the selection process, the 'I have done this and that' is much more important.

2013-02-25 21:39:04	@danharibo	yeah the autocomplete in kdevelop for c++ is really good
2013-02-25 21:39:12	@danharibo	not sure how well it will handle python though
2013-02-25 21:39:24	@danharibo	I tend to give up and use vim for everything else
2013-02-25 21:41:26	Sze	I guess someday I will end up with something a little bit like vim, but I guess it will be only some crazy editor which is horrible to use for anybody else then me ^^

2013-03-16 23:29:32	danharibo	yeah
2013-03-16 23:30:07	MJBrune	so I wrote a game in ~4 days of working 8 hours.
2013-03-16 23:31:17	MJBrune	https://github.com/MJBrune/diggy it's really simple gameplay-wise.

2013-03-16 23:41:56	MJBrune	but I just feel that I don't have a strong enough foundation with SFML to create an entire complex game.
2013-03-16 23:43:18	MJBrune	I mean I've never messed around with views.
2013-03-16 23:55:43	danharibo	they are quite simple
2013-03-16 23:56:27	MJBrune	yeah It seems like you load the entire map then section off a bit of it
2013-03-16 23:56:36	MJBrune	and have the camera follow a point (or update it)
2013-03-17 00:02:07	MJBrune	I guess I will start looking deep down for a story and write about what makes me, me. Hopefully that won't scare people too much. Once I have an idea for a game, a decent story and some good game mechanics I can then get started on pushing around abilities.
2013-03-17 00:02:25	MJBrune	I assume SFML can't be rendered in a web browser right?
2013-03-17 00:05:25	danharibo	If you use native client and port it to OpenGL ES then you can

2013-03-17 11:12:53	@zagabar	i have an array allocated as type X (say int in this example), so like X* = new X[23243]; 
2013-03-17 11:13:10	@zagabar	X* arrayPointer = new X[23243]; i mena
2013-03-17 11:13:13	@zagabar	mean*
2013-03-17 11:13:19	@zagabar	and then i cast that into a char*
2013-03-17 11:13:51	@zagabar	to store in a vector<char*> with other arrays that were of types X* and Y* and Z* or any type of pointer array
2013-03-17 11:14:03	@zagabar	so that's why they are casted into char*, to fit in the same array
2013-03-17 11:15:36	@zagabar	and then if i want to access like the 6th X value in that X* casted as a char*, i would do something similar to: *((X*) thatCharArray[length / sizeof (X)]) 
2013-03-17 11:15:43	@zagabar	and that is fine
2013-03-17 11:16:23	@zagabar	but say that i want to swap two elements of the X* array.  if it was casted as an X* array, i would just simply swap them. but if it is cast into a char*... how do i do that?
2013-03-17 11:16:50	@zagabar	and i can't cast it to an X* and still keeping it general
2013-03-17 11:17:21	@Iteem	why would you do this?
2013-03-17 11:17:24	@zagabar	i'd want to be able to only swap the elements around without casting them from a char* array, just by knowing the data size of the type X it was originally
2013-03-17 11:17:41	@zagabar	to be able to swap things around in the array that was a X* array, but is now casted into a char* array
2013-03-17 11:18:40	@Iteem	well, you could just swap sizeof(X) elements instead of one
2013-03-17 11:18:44	_Dbug_	swap is a type dependent operation. Why would you do a swap char on something that contains 'x' ?
2013-03-17 11:19:11	@zagabar	Iteem: can sizeof take an instance? or just types
2013-03-17 11:19:26	@Iteem	why storing something as char* anyway?
2013-03-17 11:19:31	_Dbug_	size of can take anything but it happens at compile time
2013-03-17 11:19:33	@zagabar	_Dbug_: because i want to swap the elements around without explicitly knowing what data they represent. that i only need to know later on
2013-03-17 11:20:05	@Iteem	you need to know at least the size of the type you're working with
2013-03-17 11:20:07	_Dbug_	zagabar, that's my point. You want to swap one byte if it's chars, two bytes if its' shorts, etc...
2013-03-17 11:20:35	_Dbug_	You have to know the size at some point
2013-03-17 11:21:35	_Dbug_	Any reason why you have to use new, can't you use std::vector<x> ?
2013-03-17 11:21:40	@Iteem	what are you trying to do? the only case I cast something to char* is binary I/O

2013-03-17 15:07:30	_Dbug_	Today that was the equivalent of fried rice... but with fried ramen instead of rice :)
2013-03-17 15:08:07	@zagabar	i ate not much at uni
2013-03-17 15:08:07	@zagabar	because i wanted to do other stuff than get food ready

2013-03-17 15:08:26	kimPtr	but it's way cheaper and healthier
2013-03-17 15:09:49	Sven	it takes you half an hour or more to make your meal and about 10 minutes to eat it. i dont like that.
2013-03-17 15:10:39	@Sarah	kimPtr, takes like 5 minutes to make paste (okay, 10, fine)
2013-03-17 15:11:28	kimPtr	yeah, pasta is pretty quick
2013-03-17 15:11:45	kimPtr	but I usually chop and fry stuff with it

2013-03-18 15:43:14	~Tank	Before I post the source file, keep this in mind:
2013-03-18 15:43:33	~Tank	It does not use C++11 features, because it was written at times when we used MSVC for Windows builds.
2013-03-18 15:43:43	~Tank	That's also the reason why there's still new/delete instead of a proper smart pointer.
2013-03-18 15:43:47	~Tank	It just did not work with move semantics.

2013-03-18 15:47:49	rexou	Tank: could you explain why you put spaces after/before parenthesis ?
2013-03-18 15:47:49	vee1	that's sad
2013-03-18 15:48:03	@Sarah	Tank, whatÂ´s assert(condition) for? You arenÂ´t doing anything with the return value.
2013-03-18 15:48:08	_Dbug_	What's sad?
2013-03-18 15:48:14	~Tank	rexou: I find it easier to read the expression.
2013-03-18 15:48:14	vee1	yeah, Tank, I like your code, except for the spaces and braces not on newline. I also like putting stuff on one line.
2013-03-18 15:48:32	vee1	_Dbug_, Sarah's joke :P
2013-03-18 15:48:32	~Tank	Sarah: It's an assertion. If assert( false ) is called, the program terminates.
2013-03-18 15:48:41	@Sarah	Really?
2013-03-18 15:48:41	~Tank	vee1: Yeah, however that's personal preference I guess.
2013-03-18 15:48:44	~Tank	Sarah: Yes.
2013-03-18 15:48:44	+danharibo	As a wise man once said, "It doesn't matter what it looks like as long as the compiler can read it"
2013-03-18 15:49:35	@Sarah	Tank, thatÂ´s a bit harsh punishment. :U But I see what itÂ´s good for.
2013-03-18 15:49:56	~Tank	Nah it's not. I don't want people to use my interfaces in a wrong way. :)
2013-03-18 15:50:12	~Tank	Everything is documented, so if you use something wrong, it'll crash right away.
2013-03-18 15:50:41	~Tank	E.g. calling delete_entity() with an entity ID that doesn't exist, it's clearly a programming error.
2013-03-18 15:50:41	@Sarah	Also, yeah, I hate c-style curly braces.
2013-03-18 15:50:41	~Tank	The best thing you can do: Crash it.
2013-03-18 15:50:53	@Sarah	mm
2013-03-18 15:50:53	~Tank	What are C-style curly braces?
2013-03-18 15:50:53	@Sarah	OH
2013-03-18 15:50:56	@Sarah	assert literally crashes the whole PROGRAM?
2013-03-18 15:51:00	~Tank	Exactly.
2013-03-18 15:51:04	@Sarah	Tank, c-style is:
2013-03-18 15:51:22	+danharibo	assert is for "oh fuck this is bad" situations

2013-03-18 15:51:22	@Sarah	code
2013-03-18 15:51:22	@Sarah	}
2013-03-18 15:51:22	_Dbug_	In my code asserts triggers a breakpoint on the test so I can debug :)
2013-03-18 15:51:23	+danharibo	K&R ?
2013-03-18 15:51:28	~Tank	_Dbug_: Yip.
2013-03-18 15:51:30	_Dbug_	(Plus it generates a minidump)
2013-03-18 15:51:54	~Tank	Sarah: assert() is also ignored if the macro NDEBUG is set.
2013-03-18 15:51:54	_Dbug_	(when there's no debugger running)
2013-03-18 15:52:30	@Sarah	Tank, IÂ´ll probably have forgotten that by the time I get near a computer than can run a text editor.
2013-03-18 15:52:43	~Tank	:)
2013-03-18 15:52:43	+Calmatory	I find the "C-Style" superior bracing :(
2013-03-18 15:52:54	~Tank	Sarah: Why is that C-style?
2013-03-18 15:52:57	~Tank	Who defines it?
2013-03-18 15:52:59	_Dbug_	Sarah, just one important thing: NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER put important code in an assert
2013-03-18 15:53:06	@Sarah	Tank, because it sucks. *dies laughing*
2013-03-18 15:53:20	@Sarah	No, I donÂ´t know.
2013-03-18 15:53:20	~Tank	Or: Never put code in an assert that should actually do something.
2013-03-18 15:53:20	+danharibo	I put braces on the same line except for outer blocks 
2013-03-18 15:53:21	_Dbug_	so no such thing as: assert(SomeImportantFunctionITestForFailure())
2013-03-18 15:53:53	~Tank	assert( win_game() == true );
2013-03-18 15:53:58	+danharibo	assert(false);
2013-03-18 15:54:12	_Dbug_	I actually use assert false :)
2013-03-18 15:54:16	@Sarah	Tank, so if you donÂ´t win, the game crashes? D:
2013-03-18 15:54:27	_Dbug_	That triggers the debugger when I'm testing something
2013-03-18 15:54:39	~Tank	Well, if you release your game in release config, no one will win at all.
2013-03-18 15:54:46	_Dbug_	Sarah, in debug it will work, in release the game will not run at all
2013-03-18 15:54:48	@Sarah	:o
2013-03-18 15:54:52	~Tank	_Dbug_: Lazy ass. :P
2013-03-18 15:55:02	_Dbug_	Because everything inside assert will be gone in release
2013-03-18 15:55:03	_Dbug_	Tank, yes
2013-03-18 15:55:08	_Dbug_	Guilty as charged

2013-03-18 15:55:30	~Tank	However I'm normally usign the debugger only in segfault situations.

2013-03-18 15:55:32	+danharibo	might as well go out with a bang.
2013-03-18 15:55:44	@Sarah	Tank, me too.

2013-03-18 15:56:50	@Sarah	Terribly.
2013-03-18 15:56:57	~Tank	Is that an assumption?
2013-03-18 15:56:58	@Sarah	He forgets to use grammar.
2013-03-18 15:58:11	+Calmatory	But has he actually gotten things written?
2013-03-18 15:58:17	@Sarah	His last sentence was âFirst do I coding graph Hix.â
2013-03-18 15:58:37	@Sarah	Calmatory, yeah, and it was the worst thing ever.
2013-03-18 15:59:10	@Sarah	I corrected it, and he was like âI donÂ´t need to pay attention to grammar spelling, attractiveness and everything. The publishers fix that. All I need is content.â

2013-03-18 16:31:56	vee1	to use the json utility library in other projects there is a .h file (like SFML/Graphics.hpp), that needs to be included
2013-03-18 16:32:06	_Dbug_	If a library depends on another library, the library should handle its dependencies itself. You should not have to include A and B yourself if all you need is B. B should be in charge of including A itself
2013-03-18 16:32:25	@Sarah	vee1, also, pragma once or something.
2013-03-18 16:32:44	_Dbug_	so B.H should have the #include "A.H", not your own code

2013-03-21 18:47:47	Haze	effects lasted longer than expected :p (~ 10s)
2013-03-21 18:48:05	&eXpl0it3r	Sarah: ?
2013-03-21 18:48:08	&eXpl0it3r	It misses Json
2013-03-21 18:48:31	@Sarah	eXpl0it3r, he wants me to write the CMake file for SSVOpenHexagon.
2013-03-21 18:48:39	@Sarah	Now that he's written the ones for everything else.
2013-03-21 18:48:55	&eXpl0it3r	Haze: Have you seen my CMake script for Kroniax, should now be deadly simple to build on Linux :P

2013-03-21 18:49:15	Haze	eXpl0it3r, already saw it :)
2013-03-21 18:49:26	Haze	good job on cleaning the source
2013-03-21 18:49:38	Haze	I wanted to do it, but quickly got bored ...
2013-03-21 18:49:38	&eXpl0it3r	Yeah 2h or so xD
2013-03-21 18:49:57	Haze	I also commited a script for packaging on linux
2013-03-21 18:50:22	Haze	it fetchs the sfml so files and create a tarball

2013-03-21 18:51:11	&eXpl0it3r	yeah just saw it
2013-03-21 18:51:44	&eXpl0it3r	Why not simply build statically and then pack the binary + resources from the install dir?
2013-03-21 18:52:05	Haze	I think it's simpler this way
2013-03-21 18:52:23	&eXpl0it3r	Sarah: Good luck then xD
2013-03-21 18:52:24	Haze	Static linking is really not popular on linux
2013-03-21 18:52:39	@Sarah	eXpl0it3r, thanks. :c
2013-03-21 18:52:44	&eXpl0it3r	I think Json gets installed differently than he handles it in the source
2013-03-21 18:53:06	Haze	Distro packages will never publish static libs, so the packager needs to recompile everything
2013-03-21 18:53:06	&eXpl0it3r	At least that's what I remember when I played around with it.
2013-03-21 18:53:21	@Sarah	eXpl0it3r, I know, Ethan Lee and I discussed it already.
2013-03-21 18:53:39	@Sarah	vee needs to change the include path from json/reader.h to jsoncpp/reader.h
2013-03-21 18:53:44	@Sarah	But that's not the issue.
2013-03-21 18:54:10	&eXpl0it3r	Haze: So you can provide the so files with the binary and it will use it (so similar to the dll files on windows)?
2013-03-21 18:54:26	Haze	yes, see kroniax-launcher.sh
2013-03-21 18:54:28	&eXpl0it3r	ah k
2013-03-21 18:54:53	Haze	I didn't invent the concept
2013-03-21 18:55:09	&eXpl0it3r	^^
2013-03-21 18:55:22	Haze	Stand-alone release almost always use this techique

2013-03-21 18:56:29	@Sarah	I was going to say that
2013-03-21 18:57:08	&eXpl0it3r	Haze: Ah I see
2013-03-21 18:57:36	&eXpl0it3r	Well I left the options open to link staticly
2013-03-21 18:57:42	@Sarah	I'm building Kroniax.
2013-03-21 18:57:42	&eXpl0it3r	Even for the runtime libs
2013-03-21 18:58:30	Haze	eXpl0it3r, I also prefer static linking on windows
2013-03-21 18:58:39	Haze	the fewer DLLs, the better :)
2013-03-21 18:59:44	&eXpl0it3r	Hehe, usually yeah, but if the hierarchy gets complicated, static linking will be the worst on windows
2013-03-21 18:59:49	@Sarah	Does Kroniax use SFML 1.6?
2013-03-21 18:59:54	&eXpl0it3r	No xD
2013-03-21 18:59:59	Haze	nope, latest snapshot
2013-03-21 19:00:12	@Sarah	The goddamned Cmake file won't find my SFML build.
2013-03-21 19:00:16	@Sarah	Usually, they do.
2013-03-21 19:00:16	&eXpl0it3r	He just uses CamelCase for his stuff
2013-03-21 19:00:20	@Sarah	But not this one.
2013-03-21 19:00:39	&eXpl0it3r	Hmm it's the normal FindSFML.cmake from SFML, idk

2013-03-21 19:02:37	&eXpl0it3r	you can delete cmake/Modules/FindSFML.cmake and let CMake use the one it usually uses.

2013-03-21 19:16:27	@Sarah	eXpl0it3r, I didn't say so.
2013-03-21 19:16:43	@Sarah	Windows fucks up sometimes and has issues with writing permissions on binaries, for me.
2013-03-21 19:16:47	@Sarah	Anyways, the game works.
2013-03-21 19:17:21	&eXpl0it3r	[00:13:45] <@Sarah> Everything works, but Windows.
2013-03-21 19:17:37	&eXpl0it3r	= fuck Windows
2013-03-21 19:17:50	@Sarah	Oh, I'm sorry.
2013-03-21 19:18:24	@Sarah	But when a bug ONLY happens on a certain platform, I believe I am entitled to claim that that specific platform is responsible for the bug, and thus faulty.
2013-03-21 19:19:03	Haze	goddamn level 9
2013-03-21 19:19:09	Haze	tunnel in ONE tile large
2013-03-21 19:19:12	Haze	fuck this shit
2013-03-21 19:19:36	@Sarah	Level 2 has that too.
2013-03-21 19:19:40	&eXpl0it3r	That's a wrong believe. The problem is not that the system is faulty, but that your knowledge of how the system is intended to work is not complete.
2013-03-21 19:19:53	@Sarah	eXpl0it3r, hahahaha, no.
2013-03-21 19:20:29	@Sarah	If a binary won't get deleted and becomes a ghost file after execution is something that is SUPPOSED to happen, then Windows truly is fucked up.

2013-03-21 19:21:41	Haze	Sarah, nope, tunnels in level 2 are two tiles large at least
2013-03-21 19:21:46	@Sarah	Ah
2013-03-21 19:21:53	Haze	1 tile is very hard :(

2013-03-21 19:54:03	Ignoritus	I need some tips
2013-03-21 19:54:22	Ignoritus	On maps loaded from files
2013-03-21 19:54:23	Ignoritus	How to most efficiently load the maps
2013-03-21 19:54:23	Ignoritus	Most effeciently store them
2013-03-21 19:54:23	Ignoritus	ect.
2013-03-21 19:54:31	Ignoritus	I'm talking very large maps, 3000x3000 tiles
2013-03-21 19:55:32	Ignoritus	the tiles being stored in a massive array
2013-03-21 19:55:52	Ignoritus	being an std::pair of two custom classes
2013-03-21 19:55:52	Ignoritus	so yeah
2013-03-21 19:55:56	Ignoritus	anyone have any suggestions?
2013-03-21 19:56:17	Ignoritus	and yes, I'm entirely aware that is probably really bad
2013-03-21 20:02:31	OmniMancer	how is the map going to be accessed?
2013-03-21 20:04:42	Ignoritus	What do you mean specifically? I'm a noob. :p
2013-03-21 20:04:42	Ignoritus	Like, how are things going to check their interactions with it?
2013-03-21 20:04:43	OmniMancer	well if the map is that huge
2013-03-21 20:04:58	OmniMancer	how much of it will be displayed or needed for display at a time
2013-03-21 20:05:45	Ignoritus	Drawing wise, it displays anything that's visible. The player has a limited LoS, anything outside of that won't be drawn.
2013-03-21 20:06:28	OmniMancer	presumably the screen is only so big
2013-03-21 20:06:44	Haze	you have to spit the map in subzones
2013-03-21 20:07:03	Haze	split*
2013-03-21 20:07:35	Haze	And use sf::Vertex for fast drawing
2013-03-21 20:07:55	Haze	you can render all your tiles in a single draw call with a vertex array
2013-03-21 20:08:35	Ignoritus	I haven't done anything specifically to split it into subzones, but I intend to only load the tiles near spawn at first, and then load the rest during gameplay.
2013-03-21 20:08:35	Ignoritus	To prevent excessive load times.
2013-03-21 20:08:55	Ignoritus	However, I don't know what you're talking about with Vertexes, would you please elaborate?
2013-03-21 20:09:23	OmniMancer	if the tiles are a texture, and the map is a set of texture co-ords for each square then you can draw it quickly
2013-03-21 20:11:09	Ignoritus	Tiles are more than just a texture
2013-03-21 20:11:33	OmniMancer	what are they then?
2013-03-21 20:11:33	Ignoritus	Essentially, they're an object containing the information for that specific type of tile, and their "layer" which is basically which group of tiles they belong to 
2013-03-21 20:11:45	Ignoritus	Their position is determined by their placement in the array
2013-03-21 20:11:54	Ignoritus	Someone here taught me that trick, might have been you
2013-03-21 20:11:54	Ignoritus	not sure
2013-03-21 20:12:31	Haze	Vertex is low-level api for drawing
2013-03-21 20:13:15	Haze	they are just coords and texture coords
2013-03-21 20:13:33	Haze	it's very handy for drawing a tilemap
2013-03-21 20:14:25	Haze	search on the forum, you'll probably find examples
2013-03-21 20:15:32	Ignoritus	I need my tiles to have information such as collision data and layers though.
2013-03-21 20:15:37	Ignoritus	Well
2013-03-21 20:16:17	Ignoritus	Maybe if I made the container a vertex, it's type the tiledata, the position in it the coords and do the layer externally
2013-03-21 20:16:41	Ignoritus	How does it being a vertex benefit me though?
2013-03-21 20:18:12	OmniMancer	it doesn't have to be a vertex
2013-03-21 20:18:27	OmniMancer	but having just a list of vertices helps for drawing
2013-03-21 20:18:40	OmniMancer	because you can draw an array of vertices in one call
2013-03-21 20:19:25	OmniMancer	and it will just draw the entire array with the right texture segments for each tile

2013-03-21 20:20:54	Ignoritus	hate to ask dumb questions, but How exactly? 
2013-03-21 20:22:17	OmniMancer	Ignoritus: are you familiar with how openGL works?
2013-03-21 20:22:34	Ignoritus	I can't say I am.
2013-03-21 20:22:38	Ignoritus	But I'm happy to learn.
2013-03-21 20:23:48	OmniMancer	to draw things in openGL you give it a list of vertices with some way they are linked (for example triangles or quads)
2013-03-21 20:23:48	OmniMancer	and it does a whole lot of linear algebra and out pops a frame
2013-03-21 20:24:23	OmniMancer	you can give the poly's described by the vertices a texture by giving texture co-ordinates for each vertex
2013-03-21 20:24:49	Ignoritus	ok...
2013-03-21 20:24:49	Ignoritus	barely understanding here
2013-03-21 20:25:07	Ignoritus	Any example?
2013-03-21 20:25:07	OmniMancer	the part that decides what colour each fragment is will use these to look up the colour in a texture
2013-03-21 20:26:12	Ignoritus	vertices?
2013-03-21 20:26:24	OmniMancer	plural of vertex
2013-03-21 20:26:29	OmniMancer	a vertex is a point in 3d space
2013-03-21 20:26:36	OmniMancer	3 numbers
2013-03-21 20:26:38	OmniMancer	that tell you where it is
2013-03-21 20:26:50	Ignoritus	I meant
2013-03-21 20:26:56	Ignoritus	Are you referring to vertices there?
2013-03-21 20:27:50	Ignoritus	With colour fragments?

2013-03-23 17:52:27	@Sarah	Ah?

2013-04-21 20:20:00	rexou	header* 
2013-04-21 20:20:03	MJBrune	when ever I try to build I get a lot of syntax errors and undeclared identifiers
2013-04-21 20:20:07	MJBrune	its not just for player
2013-04-21 20:20:27	rexou	like a mising ; after a class/struct declaration
2013-04-21 20:21:05	MJBrune	i think this is an issue with forward declarations
2013-04-21 20:21:44	MJBrune	I am using #ifndef _someheader_h #endif method to hopefully not have that happen
2013-04-21 20:22:24	danharibo	if you are including headers inside each other
2013-04-21 20:22:29	danharibo	then you will get issues with forward declerations
2013-04-21 20:23:24	MJBrune	okay so: Tile.h includes Player.h which includes Piece.h which includes Tile.h
2013-04-21 20:23:37	danharibo	yeah
2013-04-21 20:23:56	danharibo	you basicly can't 
2013-04-21 20:24:13	MJBrune	but I thought putting a pre-processer if statement to include the headers was suppose to fix this
2013-04-21 20:24:20	--	eXpl0it3r is now known as exploit3r
2013-04-21 20:24:36	danharibo	no that fixes a completely different problem
2013-04-21 20:24:44	MJBrune	oh what does that fix?
2013-04-21 20:24:46	rexou	nope, it's like having 2 headers including each others
2013-04-21 20:25:33	MJBrune	so is there a simple way to fix this or do I just need to rethink the design?
2013-04-21 20:25:45	rexou	forward declarations
2013-04-21 20:25:58	rexou	and why tile need information about player
2013-04-21 20:26:07	danharibo	MJBrune: in the compile unit for any files including Tile.h, they will include all the way to Piece.h, then Tile.h will be included (but your #ifndefs will result in no code being included), so then Piece.h doesn't have Tile defined and you get an error.
2013-04-21 20:26:07	danharibo	The solution is forward declerations.
2013-04-21 20:26:55	MJBrune	so let me ask this, what if I go crazy with forward declarations, make a header that forward declarates every class I have and include it in main.cpp is that a bad practice or a good one?
2013-04-21 20:27:30	danharibo	very
2013-04-21 20:27:32	danharibo	very
2013-04-21 20:27:34	danharibo	bad
2013-04-21 20:27:43	MJBrune	why is that?
2013-04-21 20:28:19	MJBrune	this way the compiler knows ever class it's going to need to complete.
2013-04-21 20:29:07	danharibo	Because you haven't really solved the issue
2013-04-21 20:29:19	danharibo	you've just made a mess
2013-04-21 20:29:34	MJBrune	perhaps I just don't know forward declarations that well then
2013-04-21 20:29:38	danharibo	yes
2013-04-21 20:29:53	danharibo	(that doesn't actually solve the problem, eitherâ¦)
2013-04-21 20:31:03	MJBrune	what doesn't actually solve the problem? forward declarations?
2013-04-21 20:31:28	danharibo	your big include file solution
2013-04-21 20:31:36	MJBrune	ahh yes you said that
2013-04-21 20:31:51	MJBrune	is there a good page on forward declarations?
2013-04-21 20:32:26	danharibo	no idea
2013-04-21 20:36:36	Skwint	if your solution is divided into libraries
2013-04-21 20:36:45	Skwint	then it is fairly common practice for a library to offer an "include everything" header to the application
2013-04-21 20:37:11	Skwint	but it would be considered poor form to actually include it in the library source - you should limit your headers to only what is needed as a matter of good practice
2013-04-21 20:37:57	Skwint	hence #include <SFML/SFML.h>
2013-04-21 20:38:22	MJBrune	so heres the issue though: I have this triangle of includes in my files
2013-04-21 20:38:30	MJBrune	how can I use forward declaration to fix this?
2013-04-21 20:38:57	Skwint	yeah - that's a bad sign - it implies you have a dependency loop
2013-04-21 20:38:57	Skwint	as in, bad design, but for the immediate problem:
2013-04-21 20:39:09	Skwint	header A.h : class A { ... };
2013-04-21 20:39:30	Skwint	header B.h : class A; class B { A * mA; };
2013-04-21 20:39:43	Skwint	B stores a pointer to an object which is predeclared to be some sort of class
2013-04-21 20:40:06	Skwint	it doesn't need the header because it can cope with compiling a pointer, just so long as it knows that's what it is
2013-04-21 20:41:17	MJBrune	you know what
2013-04-21 20:41:25	MJBrune	Player.h was included in tile.h for no reason :X
2013-04-21 20:41:48	danharibo	speaking of, does anybody know of any tools that can pick up dead includes?
2013-04-21 20:41:56	danharibo	perhaps clang has some option to 
2013-04-21 20:43:20	Skwint	there is one - I forget its name but there is
2013-04-21 20:44:21	Skwint	I think I saw it referenced in an SFGUI forum post :)
2013-04-21 20:44:27	Skwint	I'm going to bed - nn!

2013-06-04 22:41:54	+iostream	hm
2013-06-04 22:42:09	+iostream	But I'd probably have to build it in layers
2013-06-04 22:42:31	+iostream	like first a simple IRC thing that only parses the protocol
2013-06-04 22:42:46	+iostream	and stuff like join("#sfml") that returns "JOIN #sfml"
2013-06-04 22:43:12	+iostream	and then an actual Client lib on top of that
2013-06-04 22:43:23	+danharibo	I guess so
2013-06-04 22:43:41	+danharibo	I mean there would be a connection layer that handled the sockets
2013-06-04 22:43:49	+danharibo	an Event Layer than handled each line 
2013-06-04 22:43:49	+iostream	I'm just too damaged by this software design stuff
2013-06-04 22:44:06	+danharibo	then the Client layer than handled dispatching / processing of events in a user-friendly way
2013-06-04 22:44:06	+iostream	mm
2013-06-04 22:44:33	+iostream	I'm not sure how to design everything in a nice unit testable way and stuff
2013-06-04 22:44:55	+danharibo	well if you had the socket layer
2013-06-04 22:44:56	+iostream	which is why it's for educational purposes etc
2013-06-04 22:45:11	+danharibo	call something like EventProcessor->process(line)
2013-06-04 22:45:20	+danharibo	you could test it without being connected to a real server
2013-06-04 22:45:35	+danharibo	then test parsing lines into the right Event structures etc.
2013-06-04 22:45:41	+iostream	yeah

2013-06-04 22:47:30	+danharibo	well you should be able to if you write the Event layer properly
2013-06-04 22:47:48	+danharibo	since .say() would just dispatch an event that the connection layer can pass on 
2013-06-04 22:47:53	+iostream	yeah

2013-06-04 22:53:07	+iostream	pure virtual classes yeah

2013-06-04 22:56:05	+danharibo	You wouldn't need that anyway
2013-06-04 22:56:12	+danharibo	you could just directly inject events in the unit test
2013-06-04 22:56:18	+iostream	stuff shouldn't be dependant on other stuff
2013-06-04 22:56:36	+iostream	how?

2013-06-04 22:57:09	+danharibo	but the test can be friends with IRCClient
2013-06-04 22:57:19	+danharibo	so it could inject them via the private method or w/e
2013-06-04 22:57:48	+danharibo	there could be a handleEvent() method
2013-06-04 22:57:51	+danharibo	that gets called
