2013-02-17 10:31:11	em	so for this thing im making... someone made a node.js api for javascript, and someone made a python api for python. But the api for python doesn't seem to allow things like, "invoke this function, and have it wait, without making the whole program wait'

2013-02-17 10:31:42	Davor	if I declare 'a = b = 0' and increment b by 1, a will still be 0. however, if I declare 'a = b = []' and append something to a, it will also be appended to b. why is this so?

2013-02-17 11:09:20	Yhg1s	yeboot: when you create it. Python never implicitly creates it.

2013-02-17 11:13:14	Yhg1s	xsamurai: and when they do use pickle, they either have to jump through a lot of hoops to make things work remotely sanely (like ZODB) or they're just plain broken.
2013-02-17 11:13:29	Yhg1s	xsamurai: it's generally much simpler to stick with an ORM, instead of an actual object database.

2013-02-17 19:11:43	ssbr_	But I don't really know how to think about what you're doing, and also I'm not an expert numpy user.

2013-02-17 19:13:35	ssbr_	json assumes that tuples are lists; namedtuples are technically tuples (isinsta,ce as above), so it serializes them as lists

2013-02-18 00:07:19	asdf`	socialcoder, it's okay, once you learn one, you'll be able to pick up the other in, like, 10 minutes. Also, what's more important is the general programming skill and patterns you'll learn. There's a "new programmer" link in the /topic that is a nice python 2 compatible book.

2013-03-22 19:53:32	tkup	Hola! I need help with a threading example I got from IBM's developerworks. I pasted the relevant code piece here: http://bpaste.net/show/l54UBK6gQh7W7soDZANg/ In the def of function run, there's a "while True:" loop. How does the run function exist from this loop? I don't a "break" or any flow control. Help please!
2013-03-22 19:54:04	skimbrel	but if you must, you can find the old format specifiers here, sw0rdfish http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting-operations
2013-03-22 19:54:26	eckod	would i just create a loop on a list with conditionals against the result and then do the assertEqual() ?

2013-03-22 20:19:45	cwillu	tkup, backing up a step though: you appear to be trying to crawl website in parallel; there's far easier ways to do this
2013-03-22 20:19:54	cwillu	using the "requests" module would be one of the better ones

2013-03-22 20:20:47	cwillu	tkup, best practice is to avoid threads in python

2013-03-22 20:23:22	cwillu	for anything io related, non-blocking io is a far better approach

2013-03-22 20:24:02	cwillu	for pure concurrency, separate processes gives a far less intricate end result\

2013-03-22 21:24:06	cwillu	record the trigrams and the number thereof
2013-03-22 21:24:52	cwillu	back track the last trigram, and go from the second letter
2013-03-22 21:24:52	cwillu	(and then the third, until you're done that word)
2013-03-22 21:24:52	cwillu	then back track one more, and repeat
2013-03-22 21:25:00	cwillu	that'd be the naive implementation
2013-03-22 21:25:32	cwillu	you could break down the sentence into sets of sets of trigrams

2013-03-22 21:26:27	cwillu	sounds like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem
2013-03-22 21:26:41	cwillu	in which case, it's np-complete or np-hard
2013-03-22 21:26:44	Baribal	I think NP-hard was correct, something about this reminds me of the knapsck problem.

2013-03-22 21:29:50	lucian	right now the functions take in a single argument, which is then matched into things like that

2013-03-22 21:31:33	startling	lucian, why doesn't it? _ = object and special-case it or even def _(*_): pass
2013-03-22 21:31:45	startling	er, _ = object()
2013-03-22 21:32:00	lucian	cdunklau: i'm using rply, it's reasonably easy to use
2013-03-22 21:32:07	Baribal	cwillu, btw, the "every word is at least a trigram" already is such an added constraint. Technically my boss lowered it to bigrams already, but I think I'll manage somehow to tell him that every expression has to contain at least one trigram, or he can such my stdout.
2013-03-22 21:32:12	cdunklau	lucian: i'd just use parsley :)

2013-03-22 21:32:51	cwillu	Baribal, that's not a useful constraint though, it just reduces the size of any given instance, it doesnt' reduce the complexity of the remaining problem

2013-03-22 21:34:02	Baribal	cwillu, it also minimizes the number and optimizes the length of the result, which is what I'm going for.
2013-03-22 21:34:26	startling	lucian, oh, I see.
2013-03-22 21:34:38	startling	I thought you were going for apply_rules(_, some_action, _, _)
2013-03-22 21:34:41	Baribal	cwillu, the point is matching a lot of Tweets against a given set of sentences (about 30k) in realtime.
