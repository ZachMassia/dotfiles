2012-11-21 21:52:58	timg	is this true?
2012-11-21 21:59:50	tangentstorm	:) i'm not really seeing a true/false assertion in there... but i think there's a lot of good advice there.
2012-11-21 22:01:10	Z_Mass	Is the performance hit from using xft fonts in a terminal noticable?
2012-11-21 22:01:10	tangentstorm	timg: what part of it is surprising to you?
2012-11-21 22:02:26	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: to whom? for what? i seriously doubt it.
2012-11-21 22:03:09	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rxvt-unicode#Improving_Performance
2012-11-21 22:03:41	@intothev01d	timg, what part?
2012-11-21 22:04:50	Z_Mass	I don't do anything that crazy with the command line.. Just want a nicer font to look at than the stock uxrvt one lol
2012-11-21 22:05:39	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: there's a nice bitmap font called terminus that comes with debian
2012-11-21 22:05:56	@intothev01d	I think it's an acurate description of a way to solve programming problems, or any problem really
2012-11-21 22:06:54	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: actually, it's the font retro uses too in the javascript console.  vector fonts are obviously slower but it only makes a big difference on really old machines
2012-11-21 22:07:45	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: Cool, I'll check it out. I was using the Ubuntu fonts before, but I just switched to Arch and getting everything set up again
2012-11-21 22:07:47	tangentstorm	the terminal i'm running right now is doing truetype on a 10 year old xp box and it seems instantaneous
2012-11-21 22:08:32	Z_Mass	Ya, I think the only time I can tell the diff from urxvt and something like terminator with a fancy font is how fast ls -R / scrolls :P
2012-11-21 22:08:37	tangentstorm	that guy has a follow up post on design patterns : http://jecxjo.motd.org/code/blosxom.cgi/coding/intro_to_design_patterns

2012-11-21 22:10:20	timg	yea tangentstorm, that is true
2012-11-21 22:10:20	timg	bad question
2012-11-21 22:10:44	timg	I was more just asking to discuss
2012-11-21 22:11:03	timg	I've never considered writing test cases or parameters before even starting to solve a problem
2012-11-21 22:11:20	tangentstorm	:)
2012-11-21 22:11:23	tangentstorm	I've actually just kind of shot myself in the foot by NOT writing test cases up front.
2012-11-21 22:11:40	timg	:o
2012-11-21 22:12:03	timg	I guess it's something I'll start doing
2012-11-21 22:12:30	tangentstorm	i'm pretty sure my code works... or at least mostly works. i just have no idea because i can't run it
2012-11-21 22:14:09	tangentstorm	timg: you're using python, right? http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html
2012-11-21 22:14:29	tangentstorm	or...
2012-11-21 22:14:39	tangentstorm	http://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html
2012-11-21 22:15:43	tangentstorm	or... http://lettuce.it/
2012-11-21 22:17:00	tangentstorm	lettuce is closer to what the tool we were going to use for javascript does. your tests look very much like english

2012-11-21 22:18:30	tangentstorm	doctest is very example-driven, and good for keeping your documentation in sync with the code
2012-11-21 22:19:07	tangentstorm	unittest is sort of the general-purpose tool
2012-11-21 22:32:06	tangentstorm	https://github.com/sabren/b4/blob/master/pre/test_pre.pas <- simple test case i should have written before i even started messing with parsers
2012-11-21 22:32:11	timg	ok
2012-11-21 22:32:15	timg	cool thanks
2012-11-21 22:32:59	timg	yea would you believe some software companies don't do any testing
2012-11-21 22:36:03	@intothev01d	yes
2012-11-21 22:39:40	tangentstorm	:) yes i would definitely believe that
2012-11-21 22:40:48	tangentstorm	some software companies write their code in notepad with no version control directly on the server ( opening files up by double clicking in an ftp client )
2012-11-21 22:40:54	@intothev01d	omg barf

2012-11-21 22:41:29	tangentstorm	i learned all about it the night someone said to me... "hey, can you come help with this? we're about to ship a product and we've got a few bugs.."

2012-11-21 22:46:23	tangentstorm	php and js both really benefit from the "you can run it anywhere" thing. for about 10 years, php was pretty much the only thing you could take to any web hosting company and have your site run
2012-11-21 22:47:20	tangentstorm	anyway... here's the end of the story: I tried to talk to these guys about using our subversion repository ( they were an outside team only doing part of the site )
2012-11-21 22:48:14	tangentstorm	and they argued like mad against it... because they needed to compete on time to make a profit, and "using version control and test servers is nice in theory but this is the real world"
2012-11-21 22:48:28	timg	lol

2012-11-21 22:50:49	@intothev01d	ah
2012-11-21 22:51:01	tangentstorm	but: i've had clients on odesk or whatever come back and tell me that they went through very similar things when they tried to hire at the lowest price.
2012-11-21 22:51:13	@intothev01d	you get what you pay for
2012-11-21 22:51:55	@intothev01d	people seem to think that doesn't translate over to technology/software for some reason
2012-11-21 22:51:55	@intothev01d	or they are just stupid
2012-11-21 22:52:47	tangentstorm	well... the thing is, you can hire some really great people in other countries for a fraction of the price. it's just hit or miss.
2012-11-21 22:53:54	@intothev01d	true
2012-11-21 22:54:21	timg	i know a guy who has been paying some sri lankan like $200/week to make wordpress plugins
2012-11-21 22:54:26	tangentstorm	of course that's true no matter what country you're dealing with, but low-budget customers aren't prepared for it :)

2012-11-21 22:54:57	tangentstorm	dang, that's one expensive plugin

2012-11-21 23:03:09	timg	well, you can almost only go up from there
2012-11-21 23:04:03	tangentstorm	when i say it fell apart, it really fell apart. i couldn't afford rent, and couldn't take a job because it was still pretty much a full time job.
2012-11-21 23:04:40	timg	damn, so that was your fulltime gig
2012-11-21 23:04:40	timg	sucks
2012-11-21 23:05:24	tangentstorm	usually i could get contract work on the side just from asking around , but that was when nobody was hiring...
2012-11-21 23:06:10	tangentstorm	i started doing the odesk stuff because i had to... but by the time i figured out i could actually make a living and decent rates doing it, i was so far behind that i just had to pack up and leave.
2012-11-21 23:06:35	tangentstorm	seems like ancient history to me now :)
2012-11-21 23:07:09	timg	where did you end up
2012-11-21 23:08:12	tangentstorm	first i moved in with an ex-girlfriend i was still friends with... but it was kind of a disaster... i came home for thanksgiving and my parents offered to let me move back in, so that's what i did.
2012-11-21 23:08:39	timg	yea that usually is a disastrous situation
2012-11-21 23:09:17	timg	almost happened to me recently
2012-11-21 23:09:17	timg	glad it didn't
2012-11-21 23:09:17	tangentstorm	:)

2012-11-25 10:56:06	tangentstorm	Vesihiisi: it's going to be a combination of two old games: Joust and Defender
2012-11-25 10:57:05	tangentstorm	The gameplay will be a rescue mission thing like defender : a wide, scrolling landscape that wraps around, and you have to protect things on the ground from enemies
2012-11-25 10:57:40	tangentstorm	but instead of a spaceship with a laser gun fighting aliens, you're a cardinal fighting vampire bats

2012-12-02 15:07:56	kumul	hell, ill just tell you, so you have a variable, and its a string, every : separates directories, thats all
2012-12-02 15:08:00	kumul	there are no arrays in SH
2012-12-02 15:08:09	kumul	sh**
2012-12-02 15:09:17	kumul	here's something i was surprised to know, the only thing that unix doesnt permit in a filename is / so you can have a filename called ::::\n\n\n::\n and it will break a lot of shellscripts

2012-12-02 16:09:03	chance_z	kumul: why would that break shell scripts?
2012-12-02 16:09:13	chance_z	because it would stop at the first \n?
2012-12-02 16:24:23	kumul	chance_z: it wouldnt stop, but all things are divided by \n and thats a wrong assumption when you pipe and { ls | grep .txt} as an example
2012-12-02 16:26:04	kumul	#(as an example)         for (* in `` $nl {ls | grep .txt }){ dos2unix $^* }
2012-12-02 16:26:14	kumul	that would automatically break
2012-12-02 16:26:33	kumul	even though it is correct in most cases
2012-12-02 16:27:35	kumul	of course a *.txt instead of running a backquote sub is a better idea, but its just an example
2012-12-02 16:30:02	chance_z	yea
2012-12-02 16:30:23	chance_z	hopefully no one names their files that way
2012-12-02 16:30:27	kumul	i do just out of spite
2012-12-02 16:31:53	kumul	just saying it should be prohibited, although unix is powerful because it allows you to shoot yourself
2012-12-02 16:32:14	chance_z	there 'might' be a use case for that

2012-12-02 18:08:26	chance_z	xD
2012-12-02 18:08:47	chance_z	college goes way faster than you realize
2012-12-02 18:09:05	chance_z	once your out of high school and have real things to do you realize you actually dont have enough time!
2012-12-02 18:09:05	chance_z	it reverses.
2012-12-02 18:10:16	SirSkidmore	why were you rolling cigarettes then?
2012-12-02 18:21:15	chance_z	some of my friends smoke
2012-12-02 18:21:30	chance_z	and they roll their own quite often (hipsters) and I asked if I could try

2012-12-02 18:42:10	SirSkidmore	I sure don't
2012-12-02 18:43:09	@intothev01d	I found out something interesting about SSD's the other day
2012-12-02 18:43:17	chance_z	inform us
2012-12-02 18:43:46	@intothev01d	apparently, if you encrypt a drive after data has already been stored, it essentially becomes unencrypted at the old location
2012-12-02 18:44:12	@intothev01d	so basically you have to encrypt the drive before anything is stored on it, otherwise it may leave some data unencrypted
2012-12-02 18:44:43	chance_z	well yeah
2012-12-02 18:44:45	chance_z	that makes sense
2012-12-02 18:44:50	chance_z	never thought about it though
2012-12-02 18:45:00	chance_z	you can also just do FDE and not worry about it
2012-12-02 18:45:07	@intothev01d	fde?
2012-12-02 18:45:12	chance_z	full disk encryption
2012-12-02 18:45:18	@intothev01d	right
2012-12-02 18:45:38	@intothev01d	he didn't go into much detail about it but was explaining something to that affect
2012-12-02 18:46:55	chance_z	yeah that makes sense based on how SSD's work
2012-12-02 18:47:00	@intothev01d	i think he mentioned something about wear leveling in it
2012-12-02 18:47:28	chance_z	yeah
2012-12-02 18:47:35	chance_z	well the way an SSD works is it uses flash memory
2012-12-02 18:47:38	chance_z	and flash memory degrades
2012-12-02 18:47:45	@intothev01d	which totally makes sense for only storing certain areas of encryption, but i don't see how it could be a problem with full disk encryption like you said
2012-12-02 18:47:57	chance_z	yeah
2012-12-02 18:48:14	chance_z	technically someone could look at an SSD and try to find the files previous location
2012-12-02 18:48:30	chance_z	they would have to have resources, but yeah its possible
2012-12-02 18:49:08	chance_z	did you know SSD's actually contain on average 15-30% more storage space than advertised?
2012-12-02 18:49:31	chance_z	its compensation for degredation of the drive
2012-12-02 18:49:34	@intothev01d	yep
2012-12-02 18:49:43	@intothev01d	so a 120 is more like 128 or so
2012-12-02 18:49:50	@intothev01d	that's what mine was when I ordered it
2012-12-02 18:50:20	@intothev01d	the pro version I think even had a higher amount
2012-12-02 18:50:53	chance_z	lol
2012-12-02 18:51:03	chance_z	my laptop has a 120
2012-12-02 18:51:05	chance_z	its so nice
2012-12-02 18:51:40	@intothev01d	yep. they are fast
2012-12-02 18:51:48	chance_z	i dont use much space so it works great
2012-12-02 18:51:52	@intothev01d	me either
2012-12-02 18:52:33	@intothev01d	I store all of my media on my nas
2012-12-02 18:52:37	chance_z	my / is 7.2Gb/20Gb and my /home is 27Gb/40Gb
2012-12-02 18:52:51	chance_z	i have the entire rest of the drive to expand on if i need :)
2012-12-02 18:53:20	chance_z	im prob going to format my fedora partition pretty soon
2012-12-02 18:53:26	chance_z	and remove my old homedir from fedora
2012-12-02 18:53:29	@intothev01d	yea i've got 53 GB left so no problem here
2012-12-02 18:54:06	SirSkidmore	I need a SSD for my desktop
2012-12-02 18:54:19	@intothev01d	I was considering moving the window vm onto it but I just don't want to eat up the 30 GB or so I need for it
2012-12-02 18:54:54	@intothev01d	I don't use it enough
2012-12-02 18:56:27	chance_z	intothev01d: thats a problem I have
2012-12-02 18:56:44	chance_z	but if I can get the netflix-desktop AUR package to work i shouldnt have to do that
2012-12-02 18:57:10	@intothev01d	netflix is a bunch of bastards for shunning linux so much
2012-12-02 18:57:33	chance_z	its DRM
2012-12-02 18:57:42	chance_z	they dont want to have to deal with copyrights and stuff
2012-12-02 18:57:43	@intothev01d	ah
2012-12-02 18:58:05	@intothev01d	still bastards :D
2012-12-02 18:58:15	@intothev01d	no they're ok. i use them mostly now anyway
2012-12-02 18:58:18	@intothev01d	i got rid of cable
2012-12-02 18:58:20	chance_z	lol

2012-12-02 18:58:44	@intothev01d	they have a netflix only show coming out. it looks really good
2012-12-02 18:59:10	@intothev01d	and I think they're still planning on doing a season of arrested development exclusive to netflix as well
2012-12-02 18:59:21	@intothev01d	so go them. i'm glad they keep pushing it forward
2012-12-02 19:00:04	chance_z	yah
2012-12-02 19:00:07	@intothev01d	I would pay for subscriptions etc to buy shows I actually want to watch is the thing
2012-12-02 19:00:17	chance_z	i think streaming services will take over tv
2012-12-02 19:00:20	@intothev01d	oh yea
2012-12-02 19:00:26	SirSkidmore	I love Arrested Development
2012-12-02 19:00:27	SirSkidmore	a lot
2012-12-02 19:00:46	@intothev01d	much like data is taking over telecom (skype type things)
2012-12-02 19:00:59	chance_z	yah
2012-12-02 19:01:24	@intothev01d	hence the realignment of data plans and the big focus to get rid of unlimited and tier all the things
2012-12-02 19:01:39	chance_z	shows will just become available at a certain time each week and you can watch it whenever
2012-12-02 19:01:49	@intothev01d	I use google voice to text people, outside of the ones i text for free now because of imessage
2012-12-02 19:02:01	@intothev01d	yea can't wait
2012-12-02 19:02:34	@intothev01d	that saves me 20 a month

2012-12-02 19:23:36	chance_z	i heard about it the first time from my robotics team mate from high school, and i didnt think much of the OSL tbh sounds 'cool' i guess. then i joined the LUG and learned more about it
2012-12-02 19:23:37	chance_z	now its like 'yeah thats bad ass'
2012-12-02 19:23:46	chance_z	and soon like 'this is bad ass'

2012-12-05 14:25:12	tangentstorm	just general tutorials
2012-12-05 14:25:14	@intothev01d	yea sounds cool

2012-12-05 14:25:33	pythocy	hi
2012-12-05 14:25:36	@intothev01d	hello
2012-12-05 14:25:39	tangentstorm	hey pythocy ! :)
2012-12-05 14:25:52	tangentstorm	i posted something for you the other day in /r/lpmc
2012-12-05 14:26:03	pythocy	i'll go check it out :)

2012-12-05 14:27:08	pythocy	so... that's just some kind of hello world?
2012-12-05 14:28:00	tangentstorm	pythocy: it's a bootable operating system
2012-12-05 14:28:06	pythocy	okay
2012-12-05 14:28:17	tangentstorm	but all it actually does is go into an infinite loop
2012-12-05 14:28:25	pythocy	:D
2012-12-05 14:28:25	tangentstorm	so it's more like the shell of an operating system
2012-12-05 14:29:08	pythocy	is that .asm-file the only file that contains the operating system source?
2012-12-05 14:29:22	pythocy	if i understood correctly, others were just to build it
2012-12-05 14:29:31	tangentstorm	there's a guy trying to make his own operating system in #fpc so he can boot and run nothing but php
2012-12-05 14:29:33	Seewhen	has anyone here studying CS at a university in the states? Or is currently taking a BA in CS?
2012-12-05 14:29:40	Seewhen	is anyone here*
2012-12-05 14:29:43	Seewhen	god
2012-12-05 14:30:21	 *	tangentstorm was an art and performance / cognitive science major
2012-12-05 14:30:33	@intothev01d	Seewhen, yea I am
2012-12-05 14:31:39	tangentstorm	pythocy: no, i'm not sure what that asm is for...
2012-12-05 14:31:53	pythocy	oh, ok
2012-12-05 14:32:20	tangentstorm	from the comment, i think it's just ... maybe the basic code for an executable? like the EXE/ELF header?
2012-12-05 14:32:21	pythocy	but i'll have to leave now, i'll go eat something
2012-12-05 14:32:26	pythocy	i'll be back soon
2012-12-05 14:32:47	tangentstorm	it looks like it's just allocating ram
2012-12-05 14:34:32	tangentstorm	kernel.pp is the actual os, and it does just print hello world. sorry, was confusing it with the other one we looked at, which went into an infinite loop. :)
2012-12-05 14:59:57	SirSkidmore	keeping irssi on my server was a great idea
2012-12-05 14:59:58	SirSkidmore	hah
2012-12-05 15:00:15	tangentstorm	next best thing to having logs :)
2012-12-05 15:00:49	SirSkidmore	I need to figure out how to enable scroll-back
2012-12-05 15:02:37	tangentstorm	alt-p / alt-n?
2012-12-05 15:02:52	SirSkidmore	whoa!
2012-12-05 15:02:53	SirSkidmore	haha
2012-12-05 15:02:54	tangentstorm	pgup/pgdn?
2012-12-05 15:03:02	SirSkidmore	pgup/down doesn't work
2012-12-05 15:04:24	tangentstorm	oh. it's been a few weeks since i used it
2012-12-05 15:04:31	SirSkidmore	Weechat
2012-12-05 15:04:36	SirSkidmore	I know, I should switch
2012-12-05 15:04:41	SirSkidmore	I just haven't yet
2012-12-05 15:05:08	pythocy	tangentstorm, what's that language that was used in kernel.pp file?
2012-12-05 15:05:18	tangentstorm	pythocy: object pascal
2012-12-05 15:05:22	tangentstorm	http://freepascal.org/
2012-12-05 15:05:30	pythocy	oh ok
2012-12-05 15:05:33	tangentstorm	also known as delphi
2012-12-05 15:05:44	SirSkidmore	I also just need to buck up and start using Mutt
2012-12-05 15:07:50	pythocy	how does .md files differ from .txt files?
2012-12-05 15:08:10	tangentstorm	.md tells github and editors that the file uses markdown
2012-12-05 15:08:23	pythocy	okay
2012-12-05 15:08:45	tangentstorm	other than that it's just a plain text file
2012-12-05 15:10:27	SirSkidmore	I love md
2012-12-05 15:10:56	SirSkidmore	it's all I use on my site with jekyll
2012-12-05 15:11:40	SirSkidmore	A OS with Pascal?
2012-12-05 15:12:41	tangentstorm	one of many small ones
2012-12-05 15:12:52	SirSkidmore	I think it would be fun to write an OS based on Rust or Go, since they're so closely tied with concurrency, but maybe I just don't understand
2012-12-05 15:12:55	tangentstorm	the big one was called oberon
2012-12-05 15:13:57	-->	ChocolateEClaire (~EmilyClai@24-205-230-166.dhcp.snlo.ca.charter.com) has joined #lpmc
2012-12-05 15:14:04	SirSkidmore	hey ChocolateEClaire
2012-12-05 15:14:19	tangentstorm	dr wirth and his grad students actually built the entire computer to go with oberon, including designing the cpu
2012-12-05 15:14:52	tangentstorm	oberon language = mini modula-2, which was already a smaller/cleaner pascal
2012-12-05 15:15:03	SirSkidmore	that had to be a lot of work
2012-12-05 15:15:06	tangentstorm	oberon system = operating system built in oberon language
2012-12-05 15:15:26	SirSkidmore	I always thought Pascal was dead
2012-12-05 15:15:31	tangentstorm	the entire source code except for a tiny assembly kernel fits in like a 500 page pdf, including all the text
2012-12-05 15:16:01	tangentstorm	it's been sleeping :)
2012-12-05 15:16:44	SirSkidmore	Is it starting to come back?
2012-12-05 15:17:01	tangentstorm	it is if i have anything to say about it!
2012-12-05 15:17:08	tangentstorm	http://b4lang.blogspot.com/2012/09/sprawl-or-oberon-forth-and-stackwise.html
2012-12-05 15:17:15	tangentstorm	that's also about 500 pages
2012-12-05 15:17:22	tangentstorm	so i guess i do :)
2012-12-05 15:17:44	tangentstorm	( not really 500 pages, but way long and badly in need of editing )
2012-12-05 15:17:59	tangentstorm	but also yes
2012-12-05 15:18:47	tangentstorm	free pascal has been in development for a pretty long time, but the gui builder / rad tool ( a separate project called lazarus ) just recently reached 1.0
2012-12-05 15:18:54	tangentstorm	that got a pretty big spike
2012-12-05 15:19:05	SirSkidmore	Interesting
2012-12-05 15:19:10	SirSkidmore	I've never looked at pascal
2012-12-05 15:19:12	tangentstorm	delphi's been around the whole time, but it's been expensive
2012-12-05 15:19:14	SirSkidmore	anyway, time to go home
2012-12-05 15:19:18	SirSkidmore	be back in a while
2012-12-05 15:19:29	tangentstorm	whole time = since the dos->windows transition
2012-12-05 15:19:32	tangentstorm	seeya
2012-12-05 15:21:12	tangentstorm	pythocy: one of the core freepascal compiler guys is talking to the operating system-building guy in #fpc right now
2012-12-05 15:21:33	pythocy	okay
2012-12-05 15:21:36	pythocy	at freenode?
2012-12-05 15:21:40	tangentstorm	yeah
2012-12-05 15:21:52	pythocy	oka
2012-12-05 15:21:55	pythocy	*okay
2012-12-05 15:24:49	tangentstorm	eh, i guess he had to leave.. trying to find the logs.. it was kind of interesting

2012-12-09 21:08:17	@intothev01d	depending on how many pages or whatever eventually we could break out in to different view files as well it seems
2012-12-09 21:08:35	@intothev01d	but that's prob a long way away and trivial
2012-12-09 21:08:51	@chance_z	k
2012-12-09 21:09:51	@chance_z	ill do that
2012-12-09 21:10:50	@intothev01d	i made the changes on gitolite as well, logged in and checked and your .pub key and the user are the same and correctly uploaded so dunno if it's working now or not but i don't know what would stop it
2012-12-09 21:11:11	BigfootItIs	haha so I hate to keep bringing this up, but I think I've found a way to make this stuff work... reverting to an old version of this software, it's basically a collection of programs, using the UNIX core to handle all the advanced stuff.
2012-12-09 21:17:00	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-09 21:17:37	tangentstorm	tadaaaa: https://gist.github.com/4248001  it actually runs now. :)
2012-12-09 21:18:23	tangentstorm	still working on recursion
2012-12-09 21:18:43	@intothev01d	cool
2012-12-09 21:18:53	BigfootItIs	https://github.com/asquared/openreplay/blob/master/README <--- if y'all care to check it out, this is an older version of that video API.  it's basically a collection of programs.
2012-12-09 21:19:10	BigfootItIs	(in particular lines 51->)
2012-12-09 21:20:01	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: that seems pretty cool. why did they stop doing it that way?
2012-12-09 21:20:16	BigfootItIs	I don't know . but I like the first way better
2012-12-09 21:20:22	BigfootItIs	let the system figure out all the complex stuff.
2012-12-09 21:20:39	BigfootItIs	all that would go nicely into a .login script
2012-12-09 21:21:21	BigfootItIs	so I would use steps 1, 3 & 4, building my own #5
2012-12-09 21:21:21	@chance_z	intothev01d: foods, im almost done getting the base config stuff setup
2012-12-09 21:22:50	BigfootItIs	the problem with this code is it's not wired for high definition
2012-12-09 21:23:02	SirSkidmore	So, friday at work I found an IBM model M in perfect condition
2012-12-09 21:23:21	@chance_z	nice!
2012-12-09 21:23:42	BigfootItIs	my uncle might have a basement full of those
2012-12-09 21:24:03	SirSkidmore	It was in the plant too!
2012-12-09 21:24:04	BigfootItIs	he worked at IBM Endicott for years
2012-12-09 21:24:12	SirSkidmore	they got a really nice cover for it to protect it
2012-12-09 21:24:35	SirSkidmore	the only icky thing about it is all the cat hair stuck to the tape on the case because my cat slept on top of it
2012-12-09 21:25:13	BigfootItIs	i'm thinking of getting one of those Unicomp ones for this rig
2012-12-09 21:26:45	tangentstorm	i use this: http://www.typematrix.com/
2012-12-09 21:27:08	SirSkidmore	BigfootItIs: is that just a remake of the model M?
2012-12-09 21:27:15	BigfootItIs	I have 2 choices here
2012-12-09 21:27:32	BigfootItIs	this program is basically for live TV production.  i'm better at the UE because I run the $30,000 models of these things regularly
2012-12-09 21:27:57	SirSkidmore	tangentstorm: that looks a lot like http://www.humblehacker.com/keyboard/
2012-12-09 21:28:07	Z_Mass	While we're talking about keyboards, I may be getting one of these for christmas http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/ :)
2012-12-09 21:28:18	BigfootItIs	so I can do one of two things... either get this (http://pckeyboard.com/page/PC122/UB40B5A) and function-key the hell out of the UE
2012-12-09 21:28:22	SirSkidmore	Z_Mass: a good friend of myine uses that
2012-12-09 21:28:24	SirSkidmore	and it's amazing
2012-12-09 21:28:36	SirSkidmore	I want either a HHKB
2012-12-09 21:28:43	BigfootItIs	or get a tiny keyboard/trackball combo and a shortcut controller with video wheel
2012-12-09 21:28:50	SirSkidmore	or the CM Typefire Rapid or something like that
2012-12-09 21:29:04	SirSkidmore	I just don't need a numpad or anything
2012-12-09 21:29:04	Z_Mass	SirSkidmore: That's good to hear, I'm pretty anxious to replace my old dell keyboard lol
2012-12-09 21:29:07	tangentstorm	SirSkidmore: hadn't seen that one. nice. i swap my control and shift keys like that.
2012-12-09 21:29:07	SirSkidmore	and I like the looks of small keyboards
2012-12-09 21:29:29	BigfootItIs	yeah all the stuff I use has to have the numpad
2012-12-09 21:29:59	tangentstorm	autohotkey to the rescue :)
2012-12-09 21:29:59	SirSkidmore	why?
2012-12-09 21:31:10	SirSkidmore	this is what I'm looking at: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823129002
2012-12-09 21:31:10	SirSkidmore	but replacing those keys with blank ones
2012-12-09 21:31:46	tangentstorm	i have a blank skin on the typematrix... i decided to get one after spilling water on my last one
2012-12-09 21:32:30	SirSkidmore	I just really like mechanical keyboards.
2012-12-09 21:32:53	SirSkidmore	I'm relatively happy with the BlackWidow, even though it's designed for gaming and I don't need macro keys or lights
2012-12-09 21:33:34	tangentstorm	i want a keyboard with two trackballs or thumbsticks on it
2012-12-09 21:34:12	BigfootItIs	yeah me too.  one machine I use has a $3000 keyboard (http://rasmuscatalog.com/cgi-bin/mnlist.cgi?rasmus864/16248)
2012-12-09 21:34:18	BigfootItIs	that thing is a goddamn tank
2012-12-09 21:34:25	BigfootItIs	not soda-proof though
2012-12-09 21:34:52	SirSkidmore	I really like the looks of the HHKB
2012-12-09 21:35:05	SirSkidmore	like minimalism and stuff
2012-12-09 21:36:12	@chance_z	intothev01d: im going to commit my folder stuff
2012-12-09 21:36:27	@chance_z	and then work on the form stuff
2012-12-09 21:36:41	BigfootItIs	now I want an old IBM clicky
2012-12-09 21:36:41	@intothev01d	k
2012-12-09 21:36:46	@intothev01d	thanks for the help working on it
2012-12-09 21:39:46	SirSkidmore	BigfootItIs: just plugged mine in ;)
2012-12-09 21:39:56	BigfootItIs	yeah I gotta go cruise some garage sales
2012-12-09 21:40:30	SirSkidmore	It's a little loug
2012-12-09 21:40:32	SirSkidmore	loud*
2012-12-09 21:40:49	BigfootItIs	those things are worth it.  I love the old made in USA stuff
2012-12-09 21:41:05	SirSkidmore	wherein my sister (who's in bed in the room next to mine) just told me to stop typing
2012-12-09 21:41:05	SirSkidmore	ha
2012-12-09 21:41:47	BigfootItIs	yeah I remember that
2012-12-09 21:41:47	BigfootItIs	"we're trying to watch a movie, stop typing"
2012-12-09 21:43:23	BigfootItIs	i'm a bearclawer anyways
2012-12-09 21:45:14	SirSkidmore	I'm not totally sure what that is
2012-12-09 21:45:48	BigfootItIs	tough on keyboards
2012-12-09 21:46:04	SirSkidmore	Ah.
2012-12-09 21:46:04	BigfootItIs	if you couldn't tell from the project, i'm in the broadcasting industry, so I work in live productoin
2012-12-09 21:46:39	SirSkidmore	I try to treat mine well. I don't properly type, but I touch-type most of the time.
2012-12-09 21:46:49	BigfootItIs	we need good programmers, there's a lot of in-house stuff using C++ & VB as well as basically a giant live render farm
2012-12-09 21:47:06	SirSkidmore	then I am most definitely not your guy ;(
2012-12-09 21:47:06	SirSkidmore	;)**
2012-12-09 21:47:50	BigfootItIs	haha, we have a lot of homebrew stuff.  i'm a machine operator so I don't get into the guts of it, but I can isolate crashes from the user end pretty quickly
2012-12-09 21:48:34	BigfootItIs	the engines that feed score tickers the live info to the screen is based in C++ and Java AFAIK

2012-12-09 22:29:38	@chance_z	and read that
2012-12-09 22:32:30	@intothev01d	k
2012-12-09 22:32:43	@intothev01d	was just looking over bcrypt and password stuff
2012-12-09 22:32:56	@chance_z	werkzeug has a hasher already
2012-12-09 22:33:13	@intothev01d	yea i saw that in the bcrypt docs
2012-12-09 22:33:20	@intothev01d	that should be fine I guess
2012-12-09 22:33:43	@chance_z	https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/wiki/Large-app-how-to
2012-12-09 22:33:50	@chance_z	why dont you do the model for the user and the sign up
2012-12-09 22:33:54	@chance_z	since your already working on that
2012-12-09 22:34:01	@chance_z	and then you can get used to the folder structure
2012-12-09 22:34:30	@chance_z	and ill find something to work on, maybe something to add the book
2012-12-09 22:34:31	@intothev01d	sounds like a plan
2012-12-09 22:34:41	@chance_z	books*
2012-12-09 22:34:54	@chance_z	i added a requirements.txt file too :)
2012-12-09 22:35:10	@intothev01d	i see that. dunno why that slipped my mind. much better :D
2012-12-09 22:36:10	@chance_z	get the user model done first because ill need that :)
2012-12-09 22:36:23	@chance_z	and the user model is prob the easiest thing to just write
2012-12-09 22:36:25	@chance_z	:)
2012-12-09 22:40:14	@intothev01d	yep. i have a final tomorrow and thursday so it may be later this week
2012-12-09 22:40:36	@intothev01d	or in between it all when I get bored of studying the same old stuff
2012-12-09 22:42:08	@chance_z	okay, well i might make that model then :)
2012-12-09 22:42:22	@chance_z	should a book's ISBN be a string or int you think?
2012-12-09 22:42:33	@chance_z	it can be between 9-13 characters long
2012-12-09 22:42:34	@chance_z	always numeric
2012-12-09 22:42:41	@chance_z	so im thinking int
2012-12-09 22:43:06	@chance_z	nvm int
2012-12-09 22:44:13	@intothev01d	I don't think it ever has any alphabetic chars so int prob
2012-12-09 22:45:37	@intothev01d	i guess there's some way to handle if people put in characters and dashes if it's set as an int right?
2012-12-09 22:45:59	@intothev01d	check for numeric, if it's not respond and tell them invalid and enter with no dashes or something
2012-12-09 22:45:59	@chance_z	yeah
2012-12-09 22:46:04	@chance_z	wtforms handles this stuff
2012-12-09 22:46:15	@intothev01d	well that's handy

2012-12-09 22:54:20	@chance_z	backrefs are fucking cool
2012-12-09 23:05:17	@intothev01d	yea that's interesting
2012-12-09 23:05:26	@intothev01d	keeps relationships in sync
2012-12-09 23:06:11	@chance_z	yeah
2012-12-09 23:06:28	@intothev01d	so i guess if a user were to add a book for sale, the total amount of books for sale would go up? kind of like any normal transaction right?
2012-12-09 23:07:18	@intothev01d	or am i misunderstanding it
2012-12-09 23:08:14	@chance_z	that seems obvious to me, so im not sure if im misunderstanding your question
2012-12-09 23:09:18	@intothev01d	well you have seperate tables, books and users, so when a user lists a new book for sale, part of the transaction is going to be to update the total numbers of that book available in the book table. is that what backrefs handle?
2012-12-09 23:09:45	@intothev01d	so you don't have to manually update the count in the book table?
2012-12-09 23:10:00	@intothev01d	as part of the transaction
2012-12-09 23:11:45	@chance_z	intothev01d: no, backrefs handle a reverse lookup
2012-12-09 23:11:45	@chance_z	you define the model as so:
2012-12-09 23:12:03	@chance_z	a users object has an attribute 'books' which is a list containing multiple 'books' objects (from the class Books)
2012-12-09 23:12:18	@chance_z	you also put the backref in
2012-12-09 23:12:35	@chance_z	the backref is the attribute name which the other model would be able to use to look up in reverse
2012-12-09 23:12:45	@intothev01d	ooohh
2012-12-09 23:12:45	@intothev01d	ok
2012-12-09 23:12:45	@intothev01d	cool
2012-12-09 23:12:45	@chance_z	so i could do both: myuser.books to get books
2012-12-09 23:13:13	@chance_z	and book.user and get the user who the particular book
2012-12-09 23:13:13	@intothev01d	wow. that's nice
2012-12-09 23:13:21	@chance_z	honestly it might need to go both ways, looking at how to do a many-to-many
2012-12-09 23:13:47	@intothev01d	bridge tables!
2012-12-09 23:13:58	@chance_z	http://packages.python.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/models.html#many-to-many-relationships

2012-12-09 23:14:24	@intothev01d	http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_7/orm/relationships.html#many-to-many
2012-12-09 23:14:43	@intothev01d	that's what I'm looking at
2012-12-09 23:16:00	@intothev01d	neat
2012-12-09 23:17:08	@chance_z	so the tags should go in their own file probably, you think?
2012-12-09 23:17:14	@intothev01d	yea
2012-12-09 23:18:06	@intothev01d	really tags are part of books right? (like a category)
2012-12-09 23:19:09	@chance_z	ummm
2012-12-09 23:19:54	@intothev01d	but if you split out that snippet into a seperate file as part of the books module like books/tags.py
2012-12-09 23:20:01	@intothev01d	or categories.py or whatever
2012-12-09 23:41:00	@chance_z	yeah fixed that

2012-12-10 10:06:14	Z_Mass	Hey jfredett, was wondering if there are any simple features needed for percival I could work on to get some ruby experience
2012-12-10 10:19:07	jfredett	Z_Mass: sure!
2012-12-10 10:19:54	jfredett	I have a few tickets, tbh I'm not sure where it is in relation to being done, i'll take a look though
2012-12-10 10:22:45	jfredett	The Karma plugin might be cool.
2012-12-10 10:23:21	jfredett	I presume you're looking for initial ruby experience, so I'm poking through some of the simpler tickets, if you want something more complex, I can dig something up for you.
2012-12-10 10:27:57	Z_Mass	jfredett: I'll have a look at the Karma plugin, thanks :)
2012-12-10 10:28:47	Z_Mass	Ya I don't really have any ruby experience, I'm about 1/2 way through Eloquent Ruby, just wanting to write some instead of looking at it lol
2012-12-10 10:29:52	jfredett	yah
2012-12-10 10:33:22	jfredett	the karma plugin will probably be a good place to look then
2012-12-10 10:34:24	jfredett	I think for a first version, you can probably just store all the karma info in memory. I'm still cranking on getting percy hosted on heroku, though, so if you wanted to try using something like Redis or another (free) heroku addon, go for it.
2012-12-10 10:35:02	jfredett	the Redis bindings for ruby are pretty good.
2012-12-10 10:35:21	Z_Mass	Cool, never heard of Redis, I'll go check that out. 
2012-12-10 10:35:47	Z_Mass	Eventually the goal would be to have each users ratings persistant though, right?
2012-12-10 10:35:49	jfredett	it's a pretty sweet system, actually.
2012-12-10 10:35:50	jfredett	yah
2012-12-10 10:35:52	Z_Mass	k
2012-12-10 10:38:23	jfredett	Redis would be nice for that -- but you'd probably need to figure out how to periodically back it up, since it's in-memory (I don't know how the heroku addons are set up, you can make redis semi-persistent, but I don't know if that's possible w/ heroku's addons)
2012-12-10 10:38:32	jfredett	redis.io is the site, btw
2012-12-10 10:40:31	Z_Mass	Having a look at it now. For some reason the interactive trial won't load though.
2012-12-10 10:43:10	jfredett	weird.
2012-12-10 10:43:25	jfredett	if you're on OSX and have brew, it's worth the download (it's pretty tiny)
2012-12-10 10:43:34	jfredett	your average package manager should have it as well
2012-12-10 10:45:24	Z_Mass	Yep, it's in the arch community repo
2012-12-10 10:49:00	Z_Mass	Wow, 2 redis addons on the main heroku addon page
2012-12-10 10:49:19	Z_Mass	5 actually
2012-12-10 10:55:45	jfredett	yah
2012-12-10 10:55:54	Z_Mass	jfredett: Do you have a procfile written by chance?
2012-12-10 10:55:54	jfredett	there are a bunch
2012-12-10 10:56:30	Z_Mass	You have any preference?
2012-12-10 11:02:11	tangentstorm	awwww yeahhh.... check it out:   https://gist.github.com/4251447
2012-12-10 11:02:59	tangentstorm	hey jfredett. :) were you around for the guy from hedgewars.org ?
2012-12-10 11:03:40	tangentstorm	it's an open source worms/scorched earth style game made with a mix of object pascal, haskell, and c++
2012-12-10 11:04:13	tangentstorm	also has funding from google for summer of code and is looking for mentors / students
2012-12-10 11:04:23	tangentstorm	guy's nick is "koda" ... he hangs out in #hedgewars and #fpc
2012-12-10 11:06:57	jfredett	I wasn't, tangentstorm
2012-12-10 11:07:21	jfredett	Z_Mass: erm, not sure what you mean? I think Percy ought have one in the repo
2012-12-10 11:08:41	jfredett	Z_Mass: or not...
2012-12-10 11:09:08	Z_Mass	jfredett: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby#declare-process-types-with-procfile
2012-12-10 11:09:19	Z_Mass	lol, was going to say, didn't think I seen one
2012-12-10 11:10:03	jfredett	Z_Mass: so, procfiles require foreman, and I don't think that's installed, so first step is to add that ot the gemfile
2012-12-10 11:10:16	jfredett	and I'll dig up a example in the meantime, they're pretty easy to use.
2012-12-10 11:11:26	jfredett	percy wasn't using foreman before, and you don't need it to start up redis in this case.
2012-12-10 11:11:34	jfredett	heroku will have it always available
2012-12-10 11:11:59	jfredett	it's not a bad idea to add one -- there is a branch somewhere with the procfile added from when I was trying to get it to run on heroku
2012-12-10 11:12:35	Z_Mass	I checked the clock and logger branches, they don't have one either
2012-12-10 11:12:54	jfredett	i might not have pushed it
2012-12-10 11:13:08	Z_Mass	So when I go to add the redis gem to percival, I add it to the gemfile, not percival.gemspec?
2012-12-10 11:13:25	jfredett	I was working on it but ran into an unassailable (from my position) bug w/ how it loads gems (though it successfully acquired rbx!)
2012-12-10 11:13:46	jfredett	Z_Mass: if it's a development dependency, it goes in Gemfile, if you need it in 'production' you put it in gemspec
2012-12-10 11:13:54	jfredett	the latter is a bit different syntax
2012-12-10 11:14:45	jfredett	you do 'gem.add_dependency' instead of just 'gem'
2012-12-10 11:15:01	Z_Mass	jfredett: Gotcha. I was wondering why some gems were in one or the other
2012-12-10 11:15:59	jfredett	the Gemfile will only have it's gems installed when you have the repo checked out and do bundle
2012-12-10 11:16:00	jfredett	when you require the gem, only the .gemspec ones get pulled in
2012-12-10 11:28:08	Z_Mass	Weird, I installed heroku-toolbelt, but I don't have the foreman command
2012-12-10 11:31:42	Z_Mass	So it says for local development I should declare env vars in .env
2012-12-10 11:32:27	Z_Mass	How is that going to work when it's running on heroku? they say not to commit .env
2012-12-10 11:39:18	Z_Mass	Cool, got foreman working, and the procfile is working and using .env to load the channels. Now just need to figure out how to set the channels for heroku
2012-12-10 11:39:26	Z_Mass	jfredett: Any ideas?
2012-12-10 11:40:40	@intothev01d	you mean for it to load the channels to connect to in irc?
2012-12-10 11:41:31	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Ya, it checks for the CHANNEL env var
2012-12-10 11:41:40	@intothev01d	i believe the procfiles let you pass arguments
2012-12-10 11:41:53	Z_Mass	For local testing they say to declare them in .env
2012-12-10 11:42:27	Z_Mass	Ya you can, but I believe it would be better not to hard code in channels like that, because you may not want the same channel to test it
2012-12-10 11:46:49	jfredett	foreman is a separate tool
2012-12-10 11:47:04	jfredett	.env is for local development, on heroku, the environment is managed by `heroku config`
2012-12-10 11:47:38	jfredett	.env is just a file that gets loaded and does a simple set up of environment variables.
2012-12-10 11:49:18	jfredett	Z_Mass: up till now, I've just specified them on the command line with `CHANNELS='#percy-test' or w/e
2012-12-10 11:49:40	Z_Mass	Oh cool, I'll have a look at heroku config. 
2012-12-10 11:50:10	Z_Mass	Ya it worked fine with the .env. That's actually the channel I sent him too :P
2012-12-10 11:52:14	Z_Mass	You already have the percival heroku name?
2012-12-10 11:52:54	jfredett	I think so -- don't worry about getting it up on heroku for now
2012-12-10 11:54:11	jfredett	if you really want to try, you should just run it on MRI, and not bother with RBX -- but make sure any development you do runs on RBX too (eg, any tests should pass on both MRI and RBX)
2012-12-10 11:55:00	 *	Z_Mass googles MRI and RBX
2012-12-10 11:55:06	jfredett	it will eventually be run on RBX, I'm hoping on heroku too, but I'm less concerned about that, tbh - I've got it working on my provisioner for my linode, I jsut have to finish up the rest of it and it'll run up there more permenant like.
2012-12-10 11:55:09	jfredett	MRI is the 'normal' ruby interpreter
2012-12-10 11:55:18	jfredett	MRI = Matz's ruby interpreter
2012-12-10 11:55:24	jfredett	RBX is short for Rubinius
2012-12-10 11:55:50	jfredett	it's a fast, llvm based, self-hosting ruby interpreter
2012-12-10 11:55:50	jfredett	and my preferred
2012-12-10 11:55:53	jfredett	interpreter
2012-12-10 11:56:49	Z_Mass	Gotcha
2012-12-10 11:57:23	tangentstorm	does anyone in the ruby world ever use cardinal?
2012-12-10 11:57:42	jfredett	tangentstorm: never heard of it
2012-12-10 11:57:44	jfredett	whatsitdo?
2012-12-10 11:57:48	tangentstorm	https://github.com/parrot/cardinal
2012-12-10 11:58:06	tangentstorm	they were just starting it up when i was working on the python -> parrot compiler
2012-12-10 11:58:06	jfredett	ah- interesting
2012-12-10 11:58:18	jfredett	I remember parrot, isn't it dead now?
2012-12-10 11:58:19	tangentstorm	no
2012-12-10 11:58:23	jfredett	or was that the other perl6 vm?
2012-12-10 11:58:29	tangentstorm	in fact i was talking to them the other day
2012-12-10 11:58:37	jfredett	I know audrey tang was working on one, I thought it was hers that died.
2012-12-10 11:58:40	tangentstorm	yeah
2012-12-10 11:58:52	jfredett	pugs -- that what it was
2012-12-10 11:58:58	tangentstorm	hers was pugs, written in haskell
2012-12-10 11:59:02	jfredett	yah
2012-12-10 11:59:18	jfredett	all the #haskell folks were getting all up in #perl6's business
2012-12-10 11:59:19	tangentstorm	parrot also has mentor/student funding from google through the perl foundation
2012-12-10 11:59:27	jfredett	givin' 'em types and stuff
2012-12-10 11:59:33	jfredett	tangentstorm: cool
2012-12-10 11:59:34	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-10 12:00:16	tangentstorm	i had popped in a week or two ago to touch base about working with them
2012-12-10 12:00:31	tangentstorm	their irc channel is on another server though so i keep forgetting to go back
2012-12-10 12:01:02	tangentstorm	hmm...
2012-12-10 12:01:34	tangentstorm	i may be able to get pirate to target retro now.... that would rock :)
2012-12-10 12:01:50	jfredett	pirate = python->parrot?
2012-12-10 12:01:55	tangentstorm	yeah
2012-12-10 12:02:09	jfredett	my understanding of parrot (and vms in general) is limited
2012-12-10 12:02:19	tangentstorm	i was the lead dev on that and did a summer of code mentoring in 2003
2012-12-10 12:03:12	tangentstorm	but at the time, the object support in the vm wasn't done and i had to stop work
2012-12-10 12:03:53	jfredett	i see.
2012-12-10 12:04:36	tangentstorm	it's not even up on the web at the moment, and what's left has succumbed to bitrot... i need to get it checked into github
2012-12-10 12:05:26	tangentstorm	anyway, looks like cardinal for ruby has faired better but doesn't look terribly active, either :)
2012-12-10 12:05:26	jfredett	interesting
2012-12-10 12:05:29	jfredett	there are lots of little interpreters floating around the world.
2012-12-10 12:07:24	tangentstorm	yeah

2012-12-10 12:38:15	jfredett	to _not_ ignore a file?
2012-12-10 12:38:17	jfredett	what file?
2012-12-10 12:38:18	Z_Mass	Heroku wants the Gemfile.lock
2012-12-10 12:38:30	jfredett	you can just unignore it.
2012-12-10 12:38:45	Z_Mass	Ok, wasn't sure if you wanted to keep it ignored or not
2012-12-10 12:38:45	jfredett	tbh, percy isn't a gem, and that part should be removed.
2012-12-10 12:38:59	jfredett	I don't know why he was packaged that way.
2012-12-10 12:39:36	Z_Mass	which part, the gemspec?

2012-12-10 12:52:52	jfredett	he might do that... I haven't mucked with him on heroku much
2012-12-10 12:53:21	jfredett	I think that the app spinning down might result in him spinning down

2012-12-10 12:53:41	jfredett	hmm
2012-12-10 12:54:07	jfredett	you might have to set PORT in the config.
2012-12-10 12:54:07	jfredett	6667 i believe is the normal irc port

2012-12-10 12:55:02	Z_Mass	I'll give that a shot. 
2012-12-10 12:55:02	jfredett	I have no idea if this will even work.
2012-12-10 12:55:03	jfredett	:)
2012-12-10 12:55:28	Z_Mass	lol, most I've done with heroku is set up a wordpress for my gf

2012-12-10 12:57:55	Z_Mass	same error still. 
2012-12-10 12:58:28	Z_Mass	Oh well, I'll play around with that later. 
2012-12-10 12:58:56	Z_Mass	For now should I be able to just develop the karma plugin with a local redis server?
2012-12-10 13:06:26	jfredett	Z_Mass: yah
2012-12-10 13:07:04	jfredett	i wouldn't worry about heroku, just make sure you put the connection-string in an environment variable
2012-12-10 13:07:04	jfredett	and we can make it work on heroku no problem later.
2012-12-10 13:07:29	@intothev01d	Z_Mass, dunno if this will help but i just did a quick search for irc bots on heroku and found this https://github.com/heroku/ircbot, its written in coffee and i think uses node but I don't know if how they have it set up might help you work it out with heroku or not
2012-12-10 13:08:01	Z_Mass	jfredett: Ok, sounds good.

2012-12-10 16:12:54	Seewhen	nice
2012-12-10 16:12:54	Seewhen	In what language?
2012-12-10 16:12:54	tangentstorm	retro + pascal
2012-12-10 16:13:39	tangentstorm	maybe some javascript with melonjs for the rendering engine
2012-12-10 16:13:39	Seewhen	cool
2012-12-10 16:13:40	tangentstorm	someone was showing me this old game : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilDgNSIhW5M  (  skip to 7:00 )
2012-12-10 16:14:00	tangentstorm	it's like composing a bunch of sprites to make a scene

2012-12-10 16:23:38	tangentstorm	i'd be glad to have you on board :)

2012-12-10 16:24:10	tangentstorm	that's a good question. we're still kind of just brainstorming over in #retro
2012-12-10 16:24:49	@intothev01d	guess first thing is to understand retro-forth then, that's what you're using, besides javascript?
2012-12-10 16:24:49	@chance_z	learn retro and pascal probably ;P
2012-12-10 16:25:08	@intothev01d	lol yea that's what I was thinking
2012-12-10 16:28:32	@intothev01d	I think I'm going to work on the templates also chance_z, that and take some time to read over the other stuff about blueprints and all
2012-12-10 16:29:13	@chance_z	intothev01d: cool
2012-12-10 16:29:36	tangentstorm	retroforth is also the intermediate language for my compiler. with luck, you'll be able to write much more traditional code using a pascal-like language
2012-12-10 16:30:05	tangentstorm	and we can fall back to retro where-ever the lanugage falls short
2012-12-10 16:30:31	tangentstorm	but the way ngaro ( the vm ) works you have freestanding devices which can be written in plain javascript

2012-12-10 17:55:15	@intothev01d	changed the main boxes to buttons (links to work) added some js for the active tabs in the nav bar (wonder why bootstrap hasn't included this yet) and then set up the view for the login pag
2012-12-10 17:57:05	@intothev01d	thats interesting, i didn't know bootstrap was built in their free time
2012-12-10 17:57:29	@intothev01d	https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/b95033c270af
2012-12-10 17:58:14	@intothev01d	be back in a bit
2012-12-10 18:01:39	@chance_z	intothev01d: you can set the active tab using the templating
2012-12-10 18:01:46	@chance_z	in jinja
2012-12-10 18:01:48	@chance_z	better than JS :P
2012-12-10 18:02:06	@intothev01d	yea figured i could
2012-12-10 18:02:08	@intothev01d	don't know how really
2012-12-10 18:06:44	@intothev01d	aha! http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/tricks/
2012-12-10 18:07:30	tangentstorm	intothev01d: what should i be looking for on the site?
2012-12-10 18:08:23	tangentstorm	is that dark gray bar part of flask?
2012-12-10 18:08:48	@intothev01d	well i didn't change much I guess, aside from making the boxes links/buttons and adding the sign in page. I was just doing some basics and setting stuff up using blueprints
2012-12-10 18:08:48	@intothev01d	the one on the right?
2012-12-10 18:08:57	@intothev01d	that's I think a flask debugger extension
2012-12-10 18:09:04	@chance_z	intothev01d: you shouldn't be deploying a system with debug enabled >.<
2012-12-10 18:09:13	@chance_z	makes your host vulnerable.
2012-12-10 18:09:19	@chance_z	i set up the config to be customizable
2012-12-10 18:10:05	@intothev01d	well why didn't someone tell me these things lol
2012-12-10 18:10:05	@chance_z	you can also set up an environmental variable
2012-12-10 18:10:05	@chance_z	to store the config file as well
2012-12-10 18:10:05	@intothev01d	right, might need help on that one then
2012-12-10 18:10:05	@chance_z	we should change the config.py to config.py.dist
2012-12-10 18:10:05	@chance_z	in git
2012-12-10 18:10:05	@chance_z	and git ignore config.py
2012-12-10 18:10:18	@intothev01d	ok
2012-12-10 18:10:57	@chance_z	from there you should be able to have a config seperate from the repo
2012-12-10 18:10:57	@intothev01d	yep
2012-12-10 18:10:57	@chance_z	and then adjust your live version to have debug=false
2012-12-10 18:10:57	@chance_z	and set a real secret key
2012-12-10 18:10:57	@chance_z	and a real CSRF key
2012-12-10 18:11:42	@intothev01d	what and how do I go about getting/setting keys
2012-12-10 18:13:52	@intothev01d	already added the config.py.dist file which is a copy of config.py and changed DEBUG to false. also updated .gitignore
2012-12-10 18:13:52	@intothev01d	just need to figure out these key things
2012-12-10 18:19:21	@intothev01d	bb in a few
2012-12-10 18:41:50	akston	hey all! just joined this community and was wondering if there are any ruby or maybe python that would be good for a newbie to start trying to work on or contribute to.
2012-12-10 18:42:41	akston	percival doesn't seem to be under active development currently.
2012-12-10 18:42:46	akston	ruby or maybe python projects*
2012-12-10 18:46:29	@intothev01d	askton, actually one of our other members was working on it today
2012-12-10 18:46:29	@intothev01d	akston*
2012-12-10 18:46:48	@intothev01d	also we have the lpmcbot in python
2012-12-10 18:47:49	@intothev01d	jfredett started up the lpmc and is mentoring the percival project, Z_mass was working on a karma plugin for it earlier
2012-12-10 18:48:44	akston	intothev01d: oh, nice. i guess i'm just not sure where to start. probably just running it and getting familiar with the functionality would be good for starters eh? hehe.
2012-12-10 18:48:59	@intothev01d	yep
2012-12-10 18:49:57	@intothev01d	and if you're looking for a python project, then the lpmcbot is now mentored by chance_z. I think it may be refactored soon
2012-12-10 18:51:59	akston	okay, great. thanks!
2012-12-10 18:57:21	@chance_z	akston: what kind of stuff were you hoping to work on?
2012-12-10 19:01:20	akston	chance_z: it doesn't really matter. i'm very green so something relatively simple i suppose. i just want to get my hands dirty so i can hopefully start progressing my skills.

2012-12-10 19:25:33	@chance_z	akston: do you have any particular types of stuff you prefer? like, do you want to work on web stuff, or just simple programs? because I have web stuff you could do using flask
2012-12-10 19:25:46	@chance_z	well, i dont have a repo for it yet, i need to set that stuff up
2012-12-10 19:26:44	@chance_z	but basically i was thinking of convering a project i did last term to use sql-alchemy rather than mysql
2012-12-10 19:26:44	@chance_z	https://github.com/ecnahc515/cs275_mediadb
2012-12-10 19:27:33	@chance_z	there is code there that could be removed, like get-movie_genres(), anywhoo, id like to replace most of the get's and just make some model classes to represent these things
2012-12-10 19:27:48	akston	chance_z: my focus will probably shift to web stuff, but my logic was to work on a standalone ruby project so i wouldn't get overwhelmed by having to deal with frameworks and stuff.
2012-12-10 19:28:15	@chance_z	you mentioned python, and thats my area, so I'd be no help with ruby
2012-12-10 19:28:35	@intothev01d	*cough* flask *cough*
2012-12-10 19:29:01	@chance_z	If you want to work on Python, there is some simple stuff you could work on, and then its learning the libraries from there.
2012-12-10 19:29:01	akston	python works too, i'm equally inept at both. :)
2012-12-10 19:29:02	@chance_z	well if you want to just get a handle on python, begin with http://docs.python.org/tutorial/
2012-12-10 19:29:06	@chance_z	thats the first step
2012-12-10 19:29:13	@chance_z	get up through chapter 9
2012-12-10 19:29:20	@chance_z	classes and exceptions and such :)
2012-12-10 19:30:44	akston	okay, i can do that. thanks!
2012-12-10 19:31:29	@chance_z	akston: if you get bored, let me know and tell me what chapter your at
2012-12-10 19:31:30	@chance_z	i can give you some exercises for the other chapters or something.
2012-12-10 19:32:13	akston	i read learn python the hard way a while back, and ended up getting frustrated. i think my problem is that i try to rush through it and spend more time reading than coding and experimenting.
2012-12-10 19:32:31	--	tangentstorm is now known as tangentafk
2012-12-10 19:32:32	akston	hey that would be great!
2012-12-10 19:32:50	@chance_z	akston: just code and experiment
2012-12-10 19:32:50	@chance_z	thats the biggest part
2012-12-10 19:32:50	@chance_z	LPTHW is the other tutorial id recommend
2012-12-10 19:32:59	@chance_z	just work on understanding
2012-12-10 19:32:59	@chance_z	not memorizing
2012-12-10 19:33:35	akston	okay, makes sense.
2012-12-10 19:33:35	@chance_z	memorization comes from practice, and practice comes from trying to understand
2012-12-10 19:33:41	@chance_z	do you understand object oriented programming? or ?
2012-12-10 19:34:50	akston	i understand the basic principles, but i don't think i can look at some code and say "oh that's inheritance." or "oh that's polymorphism".
2012-12-10 19:34:56	@chance_z	ah
2012-12-10 19:35:41	@chance_z	it takes use to understand it really
2012-12-10 19:35:41	akston	well that's not completely true. i may comprehend it a little better than that, but yeah.
2012-12-10 19:35:41	@chance_z	well thats good
2012-12-10 19:35:50	@chance_z	i was hoping for that, because well. Teaching OOP is kind of hard when its someones first time around >.<
2012-12-10 19:35:55	akston	need to work on it for sure.
2012-12-10 19:37:13	akston	hehe. i've had a 500 foot view of the prgramming world for over 10 years. i'd spend a month or a few weeks learning some stuff, then quit. over and over again for years. i'm done messing around now. something's gotta give, and it ain't gonna be me. :)
2012-12-10 19:39:00	@intothev01d	Python is really a good choice either starting out or for various projects. The more I use it the more I find out about how well it really works and what neat features it has I didn't know about. I haven't used it long myself (more C++ and Objective-C so far than anything) but they all have their uses
2012-12-10 19:40:59	akston	that's what i hear. i chose ruby this time around because it looked so clean and elegant. also because i heard ruby devs are in high demand. but i guess python is catching up too!
2012-12-10 19:43:45	@chance_z	python and ruby both
2012-12-10 19:44:00	@chance_z	you wont have a hard time getting a job as a web dev if you're experienced in either/both
2012-12-10 19:44:04	@chance_z	python i feel is a bit easier to learn at first
2012-12-10 19:44:32	akston	not yet, but that's my goal!
2012-12-10 19:44:32	@chance_z	also, python is just easy to learn compared to most languages in general
2012-12-10 19:47:28	akston	here's the next question: should i go for python2 or 3?
2012-12-10 19:48:00	@intothev01d	2.7
2012-12-10 19:48:30	@intothev01d	are you on windows, linux, or mac?
2012-12-10 19:48:34	akston	both linux and mac
2012-12-10 19:48:58	@chance_z	2.7.3 is fine
2012-12-10 19:48:59	@intothev01d	python should already be on it, prob 2.7 something
2012-12-10 19:49:13	akston	i've got both 2 and 3 ready to go. hehe
2012-12-10 19:51:19	@chance_z	:)
2012-12-10 19:51:30	@chance_z	what distro you using?
2012-12-10 19:53:01	@intothev01d	chance_z, can you help me with this whole key thing? I don't understand what is supposed to go there. it's not like a ssh key or anything right?
2012-12-10 19:53:29	@intothev01d	and how does it validate or whatever
2012-12-10 19:55:30	@chance_z	intothev01d: its a secret key
2012-12-10 19:55:30	@chance_z	thats random
2012-12-10 19:55:35	@chance_z	sec
2012-12-10 19:55:50	@chance_z	prevents ession hyjacking
2012-12-10 19:55:59	@intothev01d	so i can just put anything in there?
2012-12-10 19:56:15	@chance_z	needs to be random

2012-12-10 20:02:00	@chance_z	nbd though
2012-12-10 20:02:00	@chance_z	anyways im going to had home
2012-12-10 20:02:00	@chance_z	head*
2012-12-10 20:02:01	@intothev01d	ok
2012-12-10 20:02:22	@intothev01d	yea im not sure what's up with it
2012-12-10 20:05:00	@intothev01d	akston, what editor do you use?
2012-12-10 20:07:14	akston	chance_z: Arch
2012-12-10 20:07:14	akston	intothev01d: sublime text 2 and a little bit of vim.
2012-12-10 20:07:26	@intothev01d	cool
2012-12-10 20:07:51	-->	ChocolateEClaire (~EmilyClai@24-205-230-166.dhcp.snlo.ca.charter.com) has joined #lpmc
2012-12-10 20:07:51	@intothev01d	I've used both. i've forced myself to only use vim now though
2012-12-10 20:07:51	@intothev01d	to get used to it
2012-12-10 20:07:51	akston	the more i use sublime the more i love it.
2012-12-10 20:08:04	@intothev01d	sublime text 2 is nice. it supports a vim mode too
2012-12-10 20:08:19	@intothev01d	it's just disabled by default, other than that you can enable to get movement, visual mode etc
2012-12-10 20:09:04	@intothev01d	i started trying to use vim mode with it for a while to "transition" i guess but now I just gave up and use vim
2012-12-10 20:09:10	akston	yeah i haven't enabled it yet. there's so much to learn in the base editor. snippets are awesome!
2012-12-10 20:09:49	@intothev01d	yea
2012-12-10 20:10:04	akston	vim is great, learning curve is huge though. and i tend to get overhwhelmed.
2012-12-10 20:12:08	@intothev01d	yea it's a bit overwhelming. i had to take baby steps, no frills at first. i just kept plugging along though.
2012-12-10 20:12:20	@intothev01d	i know very little about it still but i just pick up as I go
2012-12-10 20:12:27	@intothev01d	it's really damn powerful though
2012-12-10 20:13:08	akston	yep same here. just recently discovered the '%' and '.' commands. they're both epic.
2012-12-10 20:13:08	@intothev01d	see i don't even know those yet
2012-12-10 20:13:10	@intothev01d	what do they do?
2012-12-10 20:14:51	akston	'.' repeats last command and '%' alternates your cursor on the closest opening or closing bracket or brace.
2012-12-10 20:16:11	@intothev01d	yea i take it back, i remember . but the % is cool
2012-12-10 20:16:43	@intothev01d	neat
2012-12-10 20:16:48	@intothev01d	i try to learn 1 or 2 commands or so and use them alot to get it in memory
2012-12-10 20:17:11	akston	yep definitely.
2012-12-10 20:25:17	SirSkidmore	hey intothev01d can you please go set your screen name/introduce yoruself?
2012-12-10 20:25:31	@intothev01d	yep working on it now :D

2012-12-10 20:32:20	SirSkidmore	but since none of my friends know you, it's a little challenging
2012-12-10 20:32:58	@intothev01d	yea i figured
2012-12-10 20:32:58	@intothev01d	no prob i just had to set it up
2012-12-10 20:33:19	@intothev01d	also, can you see my standard icon/picture that i use or not?
2012-12-10 20:33:32	@intothev01d	if not I can add one in there. I just posted my intro
2012-12-10 20:33:43	SirSkidmore	I can see your name, no picture
2012-12-10 20:33:43	SirSkidmore	I guess I better introduce myself
2012-12-10 20:34:28	@intothev01d	aha. i have to link to my google profile. it doesn't do that by default i guess
2012-12-10 20:35:34	@intothev01d	also, you think it's better for daily summaries or combined updates? i can't tell it would make much difference, but I'll prob do daily just to insure I get the updates
2012-12-10 20:38:28	@chance_z	nice changes to the buttons
2012-12-10 20:39:31	@intothev01d	thanks
2012-12-10 20:40:04	@intothev01d	started working with the blueprint a bit… got the sign in page to show up
2012-12-10 20:40:31	@chance_z	i see
2012-12-10 20:45:40	@intothev01d	SirSkidmore, is the only way to gain points through Rule 206 or am I missing something
2012-12-10 20:45:51	SirSkidmore	intothev01d: It won't be a torment of activity, I'm just doing one email per post
2012-12-10 20:46:31	tangentafk	are you guys playing that io game?
2012-12-10 20:47:16	SirSkidmore	202
2012-12-10 20:48:28	@intothev01d	tangentafk, Nomic on google groups
2012-12-10 20:48:28	@intothev01d	ah ok
2012-12-10 20:48:28	tangentafk	the game where the rules keep changing?
2012-12-10 20:48:28	@intothev01d	yep
2012-12-10 20:48:28	tangentafk	huh. cool.

2012-12-10 20:51:00	@intothev01d	skynet is not taking over this game!!  lol
2012-12-10 20:51:00	tangentstorm	seriously doubt it would work
2012-12-10 20:51:58	tangentstorm	there are general game playing bots out there but they don't cope well with lots of branching
2012-12-10 20:53:28	tangentstorm	you can win $10,000 if you can write a bot to beat the human champs in this simple game played on a chessboard: http://arimaa.com/arimaa/
2012-12-10 20:54:33	tangentstorm	( it was also the inspiration for the push/pull dynamic in that tetraminex game i made )
2012-12-10 20:55:35	SirSkidmore	intothev01d: can't wait to read your proposal
2012-12-10 20:57:31	@intothev01d	yea I'm not sure it's great but its something :D

2012-12-10 20:57:44	SirSkidmore	I have one that I think well really help out the game, but I'm going last
2012-12-10 20:58:54	@intothev01d	i was going to do the easy one and change the one for the majority now, but I see it goes into effect after round 2 anyway
2012-12-10 21:02:10	SirSkidmore	no, that one was repealed
2012-12-10 21:02:26	SirSkidmore	it goes into affect immediately
2012-12-10 21:02:28	@chance_z	intothev01d: keep in mind we're using flask-login so there are premade things done with that, and you wont need to write a login_required decorate and other things
2012-12-10 21:02:28	@chance_z	almost forgot myself.
2012-12-10 21:02:28	@chance_z	lol
2012-12-10 21:03:11	@intothev01d	yea I was just stoping there at the sign in page, figured we could do the registration form on that page as well as the log in field (like left and right side). then I guess the other things are already done
2012-12-10 21:03:13	@intothev01d	kind of
2012-12-10 21:07:13	@intothev01d	SirSkidmore, can we put like a reason why we support our rule choice?
2012-12-10 21:07:30	@intothev01d	or does it just have to be the rule
2012-12-10 21:08:34	SirSkidmore	You can reason for it if you want to
2012-12-10 21:08:43	SirSkidmore	just look at Ryan's proposal
2012-12-10 21:09:17	SirSkidmore	I think he did a fine job

2012-12-10 21:11:26	@intothev01d	yea that's what I was eyeballing. also, since this ammends the former mutable rule, do I need to give it a higher number. I thought I read somewhere if my rule takes place it receives the ammended rules number
2012-12-10 21:13:49	SirSkidmore	intothev01d: give me a sec
2012-12-10 21:13:55	SirSkidmore	I better re-read the rules

2012-12-10 21:17:24	SirSkidmore	intothev01d: 302 as per 108 to be specific
2012-12-10 21:17:24	tangentstorm	Seewhen: did you import antigravity or something?
2012-12-10 21:17:50	Seewhen	lol no.. just in general
2012-12-10 21:18:12	tangentstorm	oh. you should try it
2012-12-10 21:18:29	tangentstorm	then import this. :)
2012-12-10 21:18:36	@intothev01d	ah ok. so if accepted then it gets the number i see

2012-12-11 15:43:08	Z_Mass	jfredett: Should the karma plugin assume redis is started?
2012-12-11 15:46:59	jfredett	Z_Mass: yah- starting redis is a start-time concern
2012-12-11 15:47:26	jfredett	it should be a rake task that gets hooked in as a dependency to the :start task
2012-12-11 15:47:37	jfredett	however, it might be good to have it disable itself / complain if redis goes down
2012-12-11 15:48:11	jfredett	eg, 'if $redis.ping' around every command or something, I dunno -- that's not super-necessary.
2012-12-11 15:48:36	Z_Mass	jfredett: K, makes sense.
2012-12-11 15:49:17	Z_Mass	Should the file it writes to for persistance be ignored from the repo?
2012-12-11 15:49:26	jfredett	yes.
2012-12-11 15:49:49	jfredett	rule of thumb -- anything generated by anything (except for Gemfile.lock) should probably be gitignored.
2012-12-11 15:50:57	Z_Mass	Gotcha. What about a config file for redis (if I end up needing one, still reading up on it)

2012-12-11 16:26:54	@intothev01d	i've been using just the commands and stuff and looking back and forth between github but I'm not going to use the app for github. it's pretty slick

2012-12-11 16:27:14	@intothev01d	lol
2012-12-11 16:27:47	SirSkidmore	the app for GitHub looks nice, but it's really not a good thing

2012-12-11 16:28:27	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-11 16:28:43	tangentstorm	i do wish i could remap the keys.
2012-12-11 16:28:56	jfredett	I want to love it. but I don't know how to work the chunk-committer (if there is one, I don't know how to tell)
2012-12-11 16:28:58	jfredett	so I just use gitx
2012-12-11 16:29:13	jfredett	for chunk commits and tree visualizing
2012-12-11 16:29:19	tangentstorm	the nicest browser i've seen is still probably the one from jetbrains in pycharm / intellij
2012-12-11 16:29:44	jfredett	sometimes I use git gr for that (which aliases to the 'pretty log output with all the branchy graphy stuff.)
2012-12-11 16:29:44	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-11 16:33:57	SirSkidmore	I just use git
2012-12-11 16:33:58	SirSkidmore	nothing else
2012-12-11 16:35:16	tangentstorm	i'm trying to adopt the "commit log as history of the project" mentality... and sort of keep it as a nice readable story of the project
2012-12-11 16:42:18	jfredett	tangentstorm: yah
2012-12-11 16:42:48	jfredett	I've recently started using `git merge --no-ff <branch> --edit` on a rebased branch,
2012-12-11 16:43:30	jfredett	it makes it so each little feature has it's own internal history, while keeping my master branch clean and deployable always. (and, by virtue, easy to bisect automatically)
2012-12-11 16:44:26	jfredett	it's been wildly helpful in some of the chef repos I've been building, because I'll get some nagging issue and all I have to do is write a bash script to check for the error, and have it bisect on the fast machine.
2012-12-11 16:44:52	jfredett	when a build is even 5 minutes, and I have 100 merges to check, it's _really_ nice to fire it and wait.

2012-12-12 16:22:49	@chance_z	hello
2012-12-12 16:22:51	@chance_z	:)
2012-12-12 16:25:43	Z_Mass	jfredett: Should I have a karma/redis.rb file to handle writing to redis? Or just put it inside karma/karma.rb
2012-12-12 16:26:55	jfredett	Z_Mass: depends, if you're wrapping all the writes in an object, then i think it belongs in another file, if your karma.rb plugin is going to just do some raw writes, then they can stay in the same file.
2012-12-12 16:28:04	jfredett	generally, I suggest the former for all but the most trivial setups
2012-12-12 16:28:22	jfredett	you can have a 'RedisWriter' object (or something) which opens up a connection, manages writes, etc.
2012-12-12 16:28:35	jfredett	and then inject that dependency into the Karma plugin class
2012-12-12 16:28:46	jfredett	that way when you test, you can easily create a mock Redis writer
2012-12-12 16:28:52	jfredett	so you don't have to actually write to redis
2012-12-12 16:29:04	jfredett	and you can test the redis-writer independently.
2012-12-12 16:30:52	Z_Mass	Ya, was trying to make a gist of my redis test class, but basically it creates a function and calls redis_is_running?, which pings the redis-server, before each write/access of redis
2012-12-12 16:31:40	Z_Mass	*creates a redis object
2012-12-12 16:32:39	Z_Mass	https://gist.github.com/4271817 there, wouldn't let me click create before :S
2012-12-12 16:34:24	Z_Mass	By inject you mean include 'RedisWriter'?
2012-12-12 16:35:16	jfredett	no, I mean dependency injection -- so you create by default a Karma plugin backend bit (not the part with the cinch stuff, but the stuff that manages upvoting and downvoting, if there is such a thing)
2012-12-12 16:35:41	jfredett	you would by default give it a variable called `redis`
2012-12-12 16:36:04	jfredett	then you use that variable to 'talk' to redis
2012-12-12 16:36:04	jfredett	in a test
2012-12-12 16:36:12	jfredett	you give it a 'fake' redis-writer instead
2012-12-12 16:36:21	jfredett	you can do that in the `#initialize` method
2012-12-12 16:36:47	jfredett	it's called 'constructor injection'
2012-12-12 16:37:11	jfredett	the idea is that now the implementor class doesn't have to know about redis at all, it just knows there's some object that can do a 'write' and a 'read' and whatever
2012-12-12 16:37:26	jfredett	so you can use anything you want with a meaningful implementation of those methods.
2012-12-12 16:37:38	Z_Mass	So I would have 3 files then, rediswriter, karma, and a plugin file?
2012-12-12 16:37:46	jfredett	mhm
2012-12-12 16:37:56	jfredett	the plugin just takes user input, and talks to an instance of `karma`
2012-12-12 16:38:11	Z_Mass	Gotcha. 
2012-12-12 16:38:14	jfredett	the `karma` plugin holds logic for looking up a person, etc.
2012-12-12 16:38:22	jfredett	the rediswriter only talks to redis
2012-12-12 16:38:53	Z_Mass	So that class I linked, should that be fine for rediswriter?
2012-12-12 16:38:56	jfredett	each has a single responsibility (the first is user-interaction, the second business logic, the last is persistence)
2012-12-12 16:39:11	jfredett	let me look at it, sorry, I'm running around a bit finishing something up
2012-12-12 16:39:21	Z_Mass	No worries
2012-12-12 16:40:32	Z_Mass	I'm going to add an incr and decr method, and a create_user which will just set a user to 0 if get returns nil
2012-12-12 16:41:06	jfredett	yah- I have some style commetns to make it a bit more ruby-ish.
2012-12-12 16:41:19	jfredett	but that's basically the idea.
2012-12-12 16:41:54	Z_Mass	K, any tips you have I'll take :)
2012-12-12 16:42:55	Z_Mass	I want to learn as much Ruby as I can while I'm in school. Hoping to get a job at Shopify which is mainly ruby/ror
2012-12-12 16:47:39	jfredett	shopify is cool, but don't discount smaller shops as well, you'll find they tend to do a lot more fun stuff than the big shops.
2012-12-12 16:49:05	jfredett	Z_Mass: https://gist.github.com/4271899
2012-12-12 16:49:06	Z_Mass	I don't know of much other places in Ottawa though
2012-12-12 16:49:12	jfredett	two versions
2012-12-12 16:49:34	jfredett	one is a simple refactor, the other uses my secret weapon
2012-12-12 16:49:40	jfredett	`require 'forwardable'`
2012-12-12 16:50:41	jfredett	there's another even more secret one, but that takes a little more work (but gives you a 'safe' version of the normal redis object. which does that connection-checking stuff, but implements all the methods of the underlying redis class.
2012-12-12 16:50:51	jfredett	and i think takes only one or two more lines.
2012-12-12 16:51:20	jfredett	but yah- now you can write extra methods in there in case you want to abstract over a particular persisting pattern.
2012-12-12 16:52:31	Z_Mass	The def looks more ruby like lol
2012-12-12 16:52:43	Z_Mass	So you don't have to call begin to do a rescue?
2012-12-12 16:57:21	Z_Mass	How does ||= work?

2012-12-12 18:15:55	@chance_z	value = x || y depending on implementation can work the same way, and is easier to read

2012-12-12 18:17:08	Z_Mass	From what I can tell, @redis ||= Redis.new will create a new Redis instance if @redis is not already defined
2012-12-12 18:18:46	@intothev01d	thats pretty cool
2012-12-12 18:19:39	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: yep.
2012-12-12 18:19:49	tangentstorm	"not x" returns true if x is undefined
2012-12-12 18:20:00	tangentstorm	because "not undefined" would be true
2012-12-12 18:21:01	tangentstorm	also "not 0" is true
2012-12-12 18:21:11	tangentstorm	so if @redis == 0 then it gets redefined there too
2012-12-12 18:21:32	Z_Mass	0 is true in ruby I believe

2012-12-12 18:24:23	tangentstorm	that's a weird decision
2012-12-12 18:25:29	tangentstorm	<shrug> okay.
2012-12-12 18:25:49	Z_Mass	I think it has to do with everything being a object. If it exists, and it's not explicitly set to false, it must be true
2012-12-12 18:25:56	Z_Mass	*an object
2012-12-12 18:25:58	tangentstorm	i don't know where i got ?= from then... coffeescript probably?
2012-12-12 18:26:06	tangentstorm	yeah
2012-12-12 18:26:18	Z_Mass	brb
2012-12-12 18:27:16	tangentstorm	i get the idea behind it... it's good to have a nice boolean type
2012-12-12 18:28:02	 *	tangentstorm fires up pharo to see how it works
2012-12-12 18:29:01	 *	tangentstorm wonders where he put pharo...
2012-12-12 18:29:27	tangentstorm	under "squeaks" of course :)
2012-12-12 18:30:20	Z_Mass	pharo?
2012-12-12 18:30:47	tangentstorm	it's a cleaned up professional version of squeak
2012-12-12 18:30:56	tangentstorm	what's a squeak, right? :)
2012-12-12 18:31:09	tangentstorm	squeak = awesome smalltalk environment
2012-12-12 18:32:16	Z_Mass	Checking out the site now. Anything big been done with it?
2012-12-12 18:32:20	Z_Mass	pharo, that is
2012-12-12 18:35:02	tangentstorm	croquet is a 3d collaborative environment
2012-12-12 18:35:36	tangentstorm	there's a project called OLPC ( one laptop per child ) that uses Squeak ( a version called Etoys ) as the main user interface
2012-12-12 18:36:02	-->	akston (~akston@24-176-24-113.dhcp.klmz.mi.charter.com) has joined #lpmc
2012-12-12 18:36:08	tangentstorm	MOOSE is a tool for analyzing software in other languages
2012-12-12 18:37:16	tangentstorm	Seaside is a pretty cool web framework written in it... there was a sort of "roll your own db" app for the web, but i think they ran into trouble or something.
2012-12-12 18:37:39	tangentstorm	anyway, lots of what you see in ruby came from smalltalk
2012-12-12 18:38:01	Z_Mass	It was one of the first oop languages eh?
2012-12-12 18:38:06	tangentstorm	yes

2012-12-12 18:38:54	tangentstorm	there was one called simula in 67 or so, but smalltalk was the one that brought the idea of "OO" to the masses
2012-12-12 18:39:24	tangentstorm	also one of the first if not the first GUI systems
2012-12-12 18:39:40	<--	bot_test (~bot_test@24-176-24-113.dhcp.klmz.mi.charter.com) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2012-12-12 18:39:41	tangentstorm	everything you see on a mac or windows UI today started with squeak
2012-12-12 18:39:51	tangentstorm	not squeak. smalltalk
2012-12-12 18:39:54	tangentstorm	smalltalk 80
2012-12-12 18:40:24	tangentstorm	the apple II  was green text on a black screen
2012-12-12 18:41:27	tangentstorm	xerox's palo alto research center ( PARC ) was doing smalltalk
2012-12-12 18:41:57	Z_Mass	that's pretty neat. having a look at the wikipedia on smalltalk now
2012-12-12 18:41:58	tangentstorm	steve jobs paid them a ton of money to get inside... and that's where the mac came from
2012-12-12 18:42:17	Z_Mass	I think I remember that from some video or documentary
2012-12-12 18:42:34	tangentstorm	then of course microsoft and IBM followed suit  with windows and OS/2
2012-12-12 18:43:18	SirSkidmore	hello
2012-12-12 18:43:27	tangentstorm	hey SirSkidmore
2012-12-12 18:43:37	SirSkidmore	Senior pictures are over now too
2012-12-12 18:43:37	SirSkidmore	It's kind of weird
2012-12-12 18:43:46	SirSkidmore	everything's wrapping up
2012-12-12 18:44:50	tangentstorm	i remember that time :)
2012-12-12 18:46:42	SirSkidmore	Like this time last year, all I thought was, "I have like a year before I need to start worrying about that stuff." Now boom, it's here
2012-12-12 18:47:24	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-12 18:48:09	SirSkidmore	and I'm nervously excited
2012-12-12 18:48:36	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: man i cannot even get hello world to work in pharo right now ... i used to at least know my way around :/
2012-12-12 18:49:00	tangentstorm	SirSkidmore: do you know where you're going to school next year?
2012-12-12 18:49:08	SirSkidmore	IU, Purdue, or UK
2012-12-12 18:49:26	SirSkidmore	but probably not Purdue, because I can't beat the international students for financial aid
2012-12-12 18:49:28	tangentstorm	to study CS, or...?
2012-12-12 18:49:36	SirSkidmore	CS yep
2012-12-12 18:50:00	SirSkidmore	Purdue has the strongest program, but I'd rather go to school for free ;)
2012-12-12 18:50:02	@chance_z	finished my first task at work :)
2012-12-12 18:50:11	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: Heh.. 
2012-12-12 18:50:19	@chance_z	implemented a new feature. Feelsgoodman
2012-12-12 18:50:27	SirSkidmore	That's so exciting chance_z. what'd you do?
2012-12-12 18:50:28	Z_Mass	chance_z: Are you working at that open source lab now?
2012-12-12 18:50:38	tangentstorm	Transcript clear ; show: 'hello world' .
2012-12-12 18:51:19	tangentstorm	the cool thing about smalltalk is you can right click a word, click "browse" and see the source and comments for the class
2012-12-12 18:51:32	SirSkidmore	isn't pharo open-source smalltalk?
2012-12-12 18:51:33	tangentstorm	yes
2012-12-12 18:51:50	tangentstorm	okay so now... to test for truth
2012-12-12 18:51:59	SirSkidmore	isn't ruby influenced by smalltalk?
2012-12-12 18:54:07	tangentstorm	yes
2012-12-12 18:54:09	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: smalltalk comes with an ide?
2012-12-12 18:54:09	tangentstorm	true ifTrue: [ Transcript show: 'hello world'. ] .
2012-12-12 18:54:21	tangentstorm	no
2012-12-12 18:54:23	tangentstorm	smalltalk doesn't need an ide
2012-12-12 18:55:02	Z_Mass	how do you get that right click to work then?
2012-12-12 18:55:44	tangentstorm	there's a TextMorph object and its menu includes things like browse and inspect and whatnot
2012-12-12 18:55:59	tangentstorm	you can also browse the textmorph
2012-12-12 18:56:03	@chance_z	Z_Mass: yeah, and SirSkidmore I added this: https://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr/repository/show?rev=feature%2F7611
2012-12-12 18:56:14	tangentstorm	or you can draw a picture and browse that
2012-12-12 18:56:29	@chance_z	thats the feature branch I did, just those 3 commits. Nothing big, but it added neccessary functionality for our .10 release
2012-12-12 18:56:47	 *	tangentstorm just realized he's basically been reinventing smalltalk for the past year...
2012-12-12 18:57:05	SirSkidmore	a django project?
2012-12-12 18:57:15	SirSkidmore	what am I looking at?
2012-12-12 18:58:48	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: in smalltalk, all the code is stored in a kind of database ( one entry per method ) and you can interact with everything... there's no distinction between the IDE and the operating system and between applications.
2012-12-12 18:59:03	tangentstorm	it's all just objects
2012-12-12 18:59:10	tangentstorm	true is an object
2012-12-12 18:59:21	@chance_z	SirSkidmore: yeah,
2012-12-12 18:59:30	tangentstorm	so you can browse true and learn about the True class
2012-12-12 18:59:32	tangentstorm	which implements a method called ifTrue:
2012-12-12 18:59:42	tangentstorm	0 does not implement that method
2012-12-12 19:00:01	@chance_z	its basically a web interface for ganeti, which is virtualmachine cluster management
2012-12-12 19:00:04	tangentstorm	so... there is no analog in smalltalk for ruby's ||=
2012-12-12 19:00:31	Z_Mass	Interesting.. 
2012-12-12 19:00:49	tangentstorm	the block syntax comes directly from smalltalk
2012-12-12 19:00:52	Z_Mass	Is smalltalk itself still used now, or just things like sqeak/pharo
2012-12-12 19:01:02	tangentstorm	[ this | this + 1 ] i mean
2012-12-12 19:01:14	tangentstorm	squeak is smalltalk
2012-12-12 19:01:26	Z_Mass	oh
2012-12-12 19:01:41	tangentstorm	i mean... there are other smalltalk
2012-12-12 19:01:43	tangentstorm	s
2012-12-12 19:02:02	tangentstorm	dolphin smalltalk... ibm has one called visualage smalltalk...
2012-12-12 19:02:50	tangentstorm	cincom smalltalk ? i think that's the market leader... it's been a while
2012-12-12 19:03:28	tangentstorm	amber is a smalltalk that runs in the web browser

2012-12-12 19:03:38	tangentstorm	click try class browser
2012-12-12 19:03:44	tangentstorm	it's really nice
2012-12-12 19:04:06	tangentstorm	you get a multi-pane view with all the modules/categories in one box, then all the classes, then all the methods/instances
2012-12-12 19:04:18	tangentstorm	this one has 4 boxes so i'm not sure what it is
2012-12-12 19:04:39	tangentstorm	oh! the xunit thing... pyunit, junit, etc... that came out of smalltalk
2012-12-12 19:04:50	tangentstorm	the first refactoring browser was smalltalk
2012-12-12 19:05:03	tangentstorm	extreme progamming came out of a smalltalk group at chrysler
2012-12-12 19:05:03	tangentstorm	yay smalltalk.

2012-12-12 19:07:12	tangentstorm	oh.. but in all those different smalltalks, you'll always have browsers and transcripts and workspaces and menus... which are like standard gui things that you don't really have on windows or linux or mac
2012-12-12 19:07:31	tangentstorm	that user interface is as much "smalltalk" as the syntax
2012-12-12 19:07:48	tangentstorm	and the syntax is really just blocks and messages
2012-12-12 19:07:48	tangentstorm	like
2012-12-12 19:07:58	tangentstorm	2 + 2 * 3
2012-12-12 19:08:04	Z_Mass	Interesting.. The online trials doesn't work for me though, gives a big error message lol
2012-12-12 19:08:48	tangentstorm	+ is a message that takes one argument   2 + 2  is the full message, and returns 4     send * 3  to that and you get back 12
2012-12-12 19:09:25	tangentstorm	there's no parser, just a tokenizer, so it can't be 8 like in ruby
2012-12-12 19:09:41	tangentstorm	that sucks. :/

2012-12-12 19:11:49	tangentstorm	well there has to be a parser, because of nested blocks. silly to say there's not ... but the language has strict message passing semantics
2012-12-12 19:12:02	Z_Mass	oh well, I got ruby errors to figure out as well :P

2012-12-12 21:25:11	tangentstorm	c++ burns my eyes, but i have a few minutes... is this for your video recorder?
2012-12-12 21:25:54	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: I have 3 more semesters of C++ :D
2012-12-12 21:26:27	@intothev01d	3?
2012-12-12 21:26:31	@intothev01d	dang
2012-12-12 21:26:48	@intothev01d	I had 3 total (ended up with 4 b/c i switch major concentrations)
2012-12-12 21:26:52	BigfootItIs	yeah
2012-12-12 21:26:59	BigfootItIs	I have a more specific question actually
2012-12-12 21:27:37	BigfootItIs	https://github.com/asquared/openreplay/blob/master/core/decklink_ingest.cpp <---- line 16 is an MmapBuffer declared.  how can I identify a unique entry in that buffer?
2012-12-12 21:27:37	tangentstorm	i took a c++ course in college. it was okay. just felt like a step down at the time.
2012-12-12 21:27:43	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Ya.. At least we are using stuff like allegro and sdl, but still. 
2012-12-12 21:27:50	@intothev01d	nice
2012-12-12 21:28:02	@intothev01d	we never got anywhere close to that.
2012-12-12 21:28:16	Z_Mass	I believe 4th semester we will be touching some python for "game scripting"
2012-12-12 21:29:12	Z_Mass	My final lab for this semester was pong. Last two were, but I had been using classes since the start, and he only introduced them for the last lab. I just handed in the same lab twice :)
2012-12-12 21:29:45	@chance_z	BigfootItIs: it looks like its essentially an array
2012-12-12 21:29:48	@chance_z	with extra member vars
2012-12-12 21:30:01	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: i believe pointers and arrays are the same thing in c/c++ so you just add the offset, right?
2012-12-12 21:30:07	@chance_z	so i mean, you would just do it the same way as an array.
2012-12-12 21:30:27	@chance_z	unique entry can be done by traversing the entire list
2012-12-12 21:30:29	@chance_z	found*
2012-12-12 21:30:33	BigfootItIs	right
2012-12-12 21:30:41	SirSkidmore	so, intothev01d can I not actually clone the repository?
2012-12-12 21:30:43	BigfootItIs	but that array is being written to 60 times per second
2012-12-12 21:30:43	SirSkidmore	Or do I need to fork it?
2012-12-12 21:30:52	@intothev01d	you should be able to
2012-12-12 21:30:55	SirSkidmore	I've never worked with a private repository
2012-12-12 21:31:26	tangentstorm	https://github.com/asquared/openreplay/blob/master/core/decklink_ingest.cpp#L57  looks like it uses buffer->put  .. there's probably a -> get too
2012-12-12 21:31:26	@chance_z	BigfootItIs: you better find a really good algorithm to find unique entries
2012-12-12 21:31:31	@intothev01d	all it means it's not open to everyone else to push/pull. you can just git clone it
2012-12-12 21:31:47	BigfootItIs	correct
2012-12-12 21:31:51	@intothev01d	and if you want to make a branch for your stuff, we can always merge it, or you can work on master and pull in the updates
2012-12-12 21:31:53	BigfootItIs	well, here's the deal
2012-12-12 21:31:59	BigfootItIs	each frame has a unique "timecode"
2012-12-12 21:32:20	BigfootItIs	where is it writing that, and how can I access that?  and yes, it does have a -> get function
2012-12-12 21:32:21	@intothev01d	typically, you make a branch for your stuff, then it will get merged to master
2012-12-12 21:32:21	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: it seems MmapBuffer is a class.. so you look for it in the source
2012-12-12 21:32:29	BigfootItIs	the declarations are in there
2012-12-12 21:32:38	BigfootItIs	if you go up on the github
2012-12-12 21:32:55	BigfootItIs	I'm just not seeing where the timecode value for that frame is being passed ot the MmapBuffer.  does tha tmake sense?

2012-12-12 21:33:53	@chance_z	intothev01d: have you used the 'git' workflow?
2012-12-12 21:34:09	@chance_z	http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
2012-12-12 21:34:13	@chance_z	thats what we use at work
2012-12-12 21:34:17	@chance_z	a bit weird to get used to
2012-12-12 21:34:21	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: put(..) is  creating the timecode value
2012-12-12 21:34:21	@chance_z	but im learning a ton of git stuff
2012-12-12 21:34:23	@chance_z	like rebase
2012-12-12 21:34:25	@chance_z	:)
2012-12-12 21:35:08	@intothev01d	cool :D i need to learn more about it myself
2012-12-12 21:35:10	BigfootItIs	ok, so going back to line 56 from decklink_ingest
2012-12-12 21:35:14	BigfootItIs	that's the put function
2012-12-12 21:35:23	tangentstorm	what?
2012-12-12 21:35:27	BigfootItIs	I don't see that argument being passed anywhere
2012-12-12 21:35:38	BigfootItIs	oh you mean the put function ITSELF
2012-12-12 21:35:39	BigfootItIs	ok
2012-12-12 21:35:43	tangentstorm	yes
2012-12-12 21:35:54	tangentstorm	https://github.com/asquared/openreplay/blob/master/core/mmap_buffer.h#L15
2012-12-12 21:36:01	@intothev01d	SirSkidmore, create a branch called bookforms or something
2012-12-12 21:36:07	tangentstorm	timecode_t put(const void *data, size_t size);
2012-12-12 21:36:10	@intothev01d	after you git clone, and then work on that
2012-12-12 21:36:20	@intothev01d	then just push that branch when you are done or when you want to
2012-12-12 21:36:22	tangentstorm	so you put some random data of some size in and get a timecode_t out
2012-12-12 21:36:22	BigfootItIs	https://github.com/asquared/openreplay/blob/master/core/mmap_buffer.cpp#L167 <--- dig this,
2012-12-12 21:36:30	@intothev01d	once complete, we'll merge it into master
2012-12-12 21:36:52	@intothev01d	I'll prob set up a development and hotfixes branch just to get used to the idea as well and leave master for production
2012-12-12 21:37:14	@chance_z	intothev01d: i wouldnt worry about it until you scale up
2012-12-12 21:37:23	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: yeah... so mmaped_ipc is probably some kind of counter/clock thing
2012-12-12 21:37:32	@chance_z	its better for large projects with numerous devs who have push/pull access
2012-12-12 21:37:36	@intothev01d	yep
2012-12-12 21:38:04	BigfootItIs	where are you seeing that?
2012-12-12 21:38:15	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: in the link you just sent me
2012-12-12 21:38:26	tangentstorm	the very next line
2012-12-12 21:38:36	BigfootItIs	right, but where is it declared...
2012-12-12 21:38:42	tangentstorm	no idea
2012-12-12 21:39:02	BigfootItIs	https://github.com/asquared/openreplay/blob/master/core/mmap_buffer.cpp#L66
2012-12-12 21:39:07	tangentstorm	probably at the top of this file or something?
2012-12-12 21:39:41	SirSkidmore	intothev01d:
2012-12-12 21:39:41	tangentstorm	everything's just global in c/c++ anything could be anywhere  :/
2012-12-12 21:39:47	SirSkidmore	will do
2012-12-12 21:39:47	@intothev01d	k
2012-12-12 21:40:00	SirSkidmore	working on getting my python environment going on my arch server
2012-12-12 21:40:36	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: ok.. it's probably declared in the mmap_buffer.h file then
2012-12-12 21:40:42	BigfootItIs	jesus that is complicated
2012-12-12 21:41:08	BigfootItIs	https://github.com/asquared/openreplay/blob/master/core/mmap_buffer.h#L35
2012-12-12 21:41:44	@chance_z	tangentstorm: c and c++ have great scope!
2012-12-12 21:41:55	@chance_z	nothings global really unless declared outside a function
2012-12-12 21:42:03	tangentstorm	the functions are global
2012-12-12 21:42:16	@chance_z	well yeah, thats how functions work in python too.
2012-12-12 21:42:20	tangentstorm	no
2012-12-12 21:42:33	rjj	Can you declare elements inside of a function as global in C++?
2012-12-12 21:43:12	tangentstorm	chance_z: python has modules
2012-12-12 21:43:41	tangentstorm	and as long as you don't use from x import *, you always know exactly where everything is declared
2012-12-12 21:44:08	rjj	Aw, but I like that statement.
2012-12-12 21:44:10	tangentstorm	pascal has this failing too, though it at least allows you to use a unit name as a prefix
2012-12-12 21:44:14	@chance_z	yeah, you cant immediately determine where a function comes from the way importing works, but it doesnt make them not global in python.
2012-12-12 21:44:32	tangentstorm	chance_z: everything is local to a module in python
2012-12-12 21:44:46	tangentstorm	it has a "global" keyword but it really means "module-level"
2012-12-12 21:45:01	@chance_z	i suppose that unless you explicitly import it, yes its local
2012-12-12 21:45:03	rjj	Is there no built-in function to trade to where an element is originally declared?
2012-12-12 21:45:04	@chance_z	your right.
2012-12-12 21:45:13	@chance_z	rjj: nope.
2012-12-12 21:45:24	rjj	... seems like it would be useful.
2012-12-12 21:45:26	@chance_z	you can look at a stack trace or something to help you though
2012-12-12 21:45:34	tangentstorm	that's why everything in c/c++ has a prefix saying what it belongs to
2012-12-12 21:45:40	tangentstorm	like everything in SDL is SDL_BLAH_BLAH
2012-12-12 21:45:59	@chance_z	rjj: you can use a debugger to step tthrough things.
2012-12-12 21:46:23	SirSkidmore	intothev01d: is the best way to install these requirements individually through pip?
2012-12-12 21:46:23	-->	cruiski (~xiatian95@211.140.5.103) has joined #lpmc
2012-12-12 21:46:27	tangentstorm	rjj: there are programs like ctags that index it... and your IDE (or debugger as chance_z said) will show you
2012-12-12 21:46:38	@intothev01d	SirSkidmore, have you ever used virtualenv?
2012-12-12 21:46:50	tangentstorm	rjj : but right now we're just looking at code on github so it kind of sucks :/
2012-12-12 21:46:51	SirSkidmore	I'm using it now ;)
2012-12-12 21:47:15	@intothev01d	ok then there is a requirements.txt file there, so if you're in your venv just do pip install -r requirements.txt
2012-12-12 21:47:28	SirSkidmore	oh
2012-12-12 21:47:29	@intothev01d	it should install all the required modules
2012-12-12 21:47:29	SirSkidmore	neat!
2012-12-12 21:47:59	rjj	... I wonder if it would be possible to represent all non-standard declarations as a tree graph.
2012-12-12 21:48:04	@intothev01d	yep
2012-12-12 21:48:34	SirSkidmore	whoa massive errors
2012-12-12 21:49:13	SirSkidmore	"Audit requires PyFlakes installed in your system."
2012-12-12 21:49:32	BigfootItIs	well, let me ask one more thing about this...
2012-12-12 21:49:38	@intothev01d	?
2012-12-12 21:49:47	BigfootItIs	how can I traverse that buffer?
2012-12-12 21:49:56	tangentstorm	rjj: i guess you're keeping up with that graph book. :) yes you can. and in fact, that's how a compiler works. the structure is called a symbol table
2012-12-12 21:49:57	<--	cruiski (~xiatian95@211.140.5.103) has quit
2012-12-12 21:49:58	BigfootItIs	just in general.
2012-12-12 21:50:32	@intothev01d	are you using python 3?
2012-12-12 21:51:01	rjj	tangentstorm: yeah, I have been sticking to it.  This book has really been putting the science in CS for me.  It doesn't have any information related to compilers though, from what the ToC says.
2012-12-12 21:51:16	SirSkidmore	shit yeah
2012-12-12 21:51:19	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: probably there's a bunch of those record objects from line 27 in mmmap_buffer.h somewhere?
2012-12-12 21:51:26	@intothev01d	flask doesn't work with python 3 yet
2012-12-12 21:51:26	SirSkidmore	I don't know why
2012-12-12 21:51:45	SirSkidmore	how do I use python2 with both isntalled?
2012-12-12 21:51:54	 *	SirSkidmore doesn't know a lot about python yet
2012-12-12 21:52:08	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: it looks like the's just a giant array of data somewhere and you use those records to see which sections of the blob contain data
2012-12-12 21:52:13	tangentstorm	contain each frame i mean
2012-12-12 21:52:34	BigfootItIs	https://github.com/asquared/openreplay/blob/master/core/mmap_buffer.h#L11 <--- could you maybe give me a quick rundown of what all these declarations appear to do?  i'm not familiar with the typdef, volatile arguments...
2012-12-12 21:52:43	tangentstorm	rjj: i've been working on a really simple compiler if you want to see an example of what you're talking about
2012-12-12 21:53:25	tangentstorm	rjj: https://github.com/tangentstorm/PL0-Language-Tools/commit/a8e253cc8ae25b7329afad970b390b7d6e6ed1ad
2012-12-12 21:54:14	SirSkidmore	neverming intothev01d got it
2012-12-12 21:54:16	@intothev01d	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4340873/how-do-you-switch-between-python-2-and-3-and-vice-versa
2012-12-12 21:54:17	tangentstorm	rjj: i'm using a stack here, because i only need to look at one scope at a time... but the top of my stack is a leaf in your tree... in an IDE or something there would be lots of branches - one per file or whatever
2012-12-12 21:54:18	@intothev01d	oh ok
2012-12-12 21:54:19	@intothev01d	cool
2012-12-12 21:54:34	BigfootItIs	https://github.com/asquared/openreplay/blob/master/core/playoutd.cpp#L283 <---- AHA... think I got it here
2012-12-12 21:54:43	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: a typedef creates a new type with a new name. i don't know the syntax exactly.
2012-12-12 21:55:55	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: volatile... not 100% sure. in java it's a keyword having to do with threading... iirc it basically makes sure only one thread accesses the variable at a time. perhaps it means the same in c++ but not sure
2012-12-12 21:55:58	BigfootItIs	https://github.com/asquared/openreplay/blob/master/core/mmap_buffer.h#L16 <--- this is it.  I didn't realize that the .h here was defining functions
2012-12-12 21:57:12	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: so... as i said, anything can be anywhere in c/c++ but... these are not function definitions... just *declarations*
2012-12-12 21:57:31	BigfootItIs	right.
2012-12-12 21:57:39	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: the usual convention is to put the declarations in an *.h file and the definitions in the *.cpp file
2012-12-12 21:57:45	BigfootItIs	but it defines the type to be returned, right?
2012-12-12 21:57:58	@intothev01d	be back later
2012-12-12 21:58:30	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: yeah so like line 9 is saying that timecode_t  is just another word for int
2012-12-12 21:58:50	BigfootItIs	right, type integer
2012-12-12 21:59:15	BigfootItIs	interesting.  so it looks like the put function stripes the timecode right in the buffer, you can't pass the timecode value TO the buffer.
2012-12-12 22:00:06	tangentstorm	again, from a fuzzy memory, i think maybe there are two words like that... maybe type and typedef? one of them just creates an alias and the other actually tells the compiler that it HAS to be of the same type, so you can't asign something that is declared as just a plain old int
2012-12-12 22:00:31	BigfootItIs	I see.  I think this whole timecode structure needs to be rebuilt
2012-12-12 22:00:36	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: that sounds right to me. the frames are probably all different sizes
2012-12-12 22:01:04	tangentstorm	that's why i say there's probably a list of records somewhere
2012-12-12 22:01:11	BigfootItIs	the frames would be uniform (but it has to be told.)  I'd prefer it if the ingest program would pass the timecode along with the frame on the put function
2012-12-12 22:01:57	rjj	tangentstorm: I still haven't found an IDE that feels right to me yet.  Are there any that you would recommend?
2012-12-12 22:02:09	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: that's not how video codecs work though...
2012-12-12 22:02:30	<--	Seewhen (~IceChat77@ti0008a380-dhcp0637.bb.online.no) has quit (Quit: Oops. My brain just hit a bad sector)
2012-12-12 22:02:43	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: people can't afford ram and hard drives to do that and still have a nice picture :)
2012-12-12 22:02:55	BigfootItIs	right, but doesn't the buffer have nothing to do with that?  the timecode is arbitrary
2012-12-12 22:03:07	BigfootItIs	the frame's compressed when it's sent via the put-> function
2012-12-12 22:03:57	tangentstorm	rjj: i use emacs for most things, but often couple it with a language-specific ide... (lazarus, pycharm, flashdevelop, visual c# express, netbeans (for php!)...)
2012-12-12 22:05:38	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: the comment on line 34 of mmap_buffer.h looks like it's saying lots of different processes/threads are going to be active at once... so the buffer is acting as the central clock
2012-12-12 22:05:51	tangentstorm	clock in video time i think
2012-12-12 22:06:25	BigfootItIs	ok, very good... once I get my hardware later this week I think I've got the code boiled down enough to run some more tests
2012-12-12 22:06:39	BigfootItIs	if it assigns the timecode in a logical way as is, then it works out of the box
2012-12-12 22:06:47	tangentstorm	so if you get ten frames from process A and 5 from process B and 5 from process C it mixes them all together into one stream... <again, this is a wild guess... i don't even know what program I'm looking at here :) >
2012-12-12 22:07:18	tangentstorm	good luck with it. :)
2012-12-12 22:07:26	BigfootItIs	they're pieces actually, basically it's going to start a few different programs
2012-12-12 22:07:52	tangentstorm	rjj: have you decided on a language yet?
2012-12-12 22:08:07	BigfootItIs	ingest starts the capture card and begins recording, playout starts the output card (independent from VGA display) and sdl_gui starts a rudimentary front end
2012-12-12 22:08:13	BigfootItIs	so those can all be a .login
2012-12-12 22:09:07	tangentstorm	BigfootItIs: i just realized that "_ipc" suffix means interprocess comumincation
2012-12-12 22:09:27	BigfootItIs	...and that is how the buffer is shared between ingest and playout
2012-12-12 22:09:32	 *	tangentstorm can actually spell perfectly well... he just can't type :)
2012-12-12 22:09:44	tangentstorm	makes sense to me
2012-12-12 22:10:05	BigfootItIs	very good.  I think I need to record a raw stream then write a dummy program to play out all the timecode data/etc
2012-12-12 22:10:15	BigfootItIs	well, not raw, compressed and al
2012-12-12 22:10:26	BigfootItIs	i've already recorded a raw stream, 4GB for 10 seconds of vid, haha
2012-12-12 22:10:30	rjj	tangentstorm: Python is working out well enough.  I'm not a fan of the whitespace rules but just about everything else appears to make sense.
2012-12-12 22:10:40	rjj	The lack of boilerplate is a big plus.
2012-12-12 22:12:47	tangentstorm	yeah. in that case: python if you can afford it... it was < $100 when i bought it, and ther's a free trial... otherwise... pydev, which is a really nice eclipse plugin
2012-12-12 22:13:09	tangentstorm	not python... pycharm if you can afford it ;)
2012-12-12 22:13:19	@chance_z	ide? pft
2012-12-12 22:14:06	tangentstorm	says someone who's clearly never tried a decent IDE :)
2012-12-12 22:14:49	Z_Mass	I used to use Wing IDE for python
2012-12-12 22:15:11	Z_Mass	They have a free version (Wing 101 I think)
2012-12-12 22:15:12	tangentstorm	i never in a million years believed i would shell out money for an IDE... but pycharm is just too good :)
2012-12-12 22:15:37	tangentstorm	i haven't looked at wing in a long while
2012-12-12 22:16:16	tangentstorm	the activestate one (komodo?) is decent.. it's built on the mozilla platform... it was just really slow back in the day when i tried it
2012-12-12 22:16:47	tangentstorm	there have been several recent ones written in python that I haven't kept up with at all
2012-12-12 22:17:04	Z_Mass	I say just go with something like vim or Sublime 
2012-12-12 22:17:17	Z_Mass	Sublime has a nice package system
2012-12-12 22:17:43	rjj	I've looked at the ActiveState offering but they're charging for the full package.  There's a limited version still out for free, but I mean /limited/.
2012-12-12 22:18:08	SirSkidmore	tangentstorm: have you seen the ninja one
2012-12-12 22:18:36	tangentstorm	sublime looks neat from the web page
2012-12-12 22:18:40	SirSkidmore	http://ninja-ide.org/
2012-12-12 22:18:47	tangentstorm	looks like it's built on chrome
2012-12-12 22:19:16	tangentstorm	SirSkidmore: nope, never seen it until just now
2012-12-12 22:20:02	SirSkidmore	tangentstorm: I haven't used it
2012-12-12 22:20:14	SirSkidmore	but it looks cools
2012-12-12 22:20:53	tangentstorm	it's got a nice web page
2012-12-12 22:21:26	SirSkidmore	for sure
2012-12-12 22:21:35	Z_Mass	Ninja IDE has a nice site anyways
2012-12-12 22:21:44	Z_Mass	Is it strictly for Python?
2012-12-12 22:21:52	tangentstorm	it said multi-language on there somewhere
2012-12-12 22:22:31	tangentstorm	i also like diakonos ... i've barely used it but i like it on principle :)
2012-12-12 22:22:42	tangentstorm	it's a console mode editor written in ruby
2012-12-12 22:22:53	tangentstorm	with a nice license
2012-12-12 22:23:12	tangentstorm	seems like a pretty simple/straightforward codebase from what i saw of it too
2012-12-12 22:23:31	Z_Mass	Heh, first two hits are Diakonos Retreat Society in Calgary and something about the New Testament Greek Lexicon
2012-12-12 22:23:45	tangentstorm	yeah you have to search diakonos ruby editor or something
2012-12-12 22:23:54	tangentstorm	it always takes me a few times to try it
2012-12-12 22:23:59	Z_Mass	It's the third one, diakonos linux editor
2012-12-12 22:24:43	tangentstorm	http://diakonos.pist0s.ca/features/
2012-12-12 22:24:46	tangentstorm	yeah
2012-12-12 22:25:54	tangentstorm	ttps://github.com/Pistos/diakonos

2012-12-12 22:28:00	tangentstorm	yep does appear to use curses.

2012-12-12 22:29:19	tangentstorm	it had a nice license so i've been considering it for a port to pascal / whatever my language is called
2012-12-12 22:29:49	tangentstorm	i also tried it out and it's kinda cool

2012-12-12 23:53:21	Z_Mass	jfredett: Have time for a quick math question?
2012-12-12 23:59:02	jfredett	this is from earilier -- Z_Mass -- not sure how much time I'll have, train internet is shite. -- ||= is actually just `x = x || y`, but the semantics of the || operator in ruby are weird, because of 'truthyness' -- everything but false and nil is 'truthy' in ruby, and will evaluate to 'true', an uninitialized variable is by default 'nil' and 'x || y' will either be 'x' or 'y', depending on which is 'truthy' --
2012-12-12 23:59:03	jfredett	if neither, then it's 'nil' or 'false' (depending on if y is nil or false) and yes -- ruby supports a shorthand, you can catch an error raised anywhere in a method by just putting 'rescue' at the end, it's traditional to de-dent it to match the 'def' indentation level
2012-12-12 23:59:17	jfredett	and sure, but then i have to go to sleep
2012-12-12 23:59:28	jfredett	or my wife will kill me
2012-12-12 23:59:32	jfredett	with fire.
2012-12-13 00:00:32	Z_Mass	Ya we ended up figuring that out. Very cool though. I did have to add an "extend Forwardable" to get it to run though :)
2012-12-13 00:00:45	jfredett	yes - i forgot that
2012-12-13 00:00:48	jfredett	*doh*
2012-12-13 00:01:06	jfredett	the tricksy version uses `require 'delegate'` and DelegateClass
2012-12-13 00:01:12	Z_Mass	Ok should be quick. How do you get the inverse of e^x? I have to solve 1000000 = 100 e^2t
2012-12-13 00:01:12	jfredett	but like I said, tricksy.
2012-12-13 00:01:29	jfredett	ln(e^x) = x
2012-12-13 00:02:42	Z_Mass	Hmm, I'll have to look into the DelegateClass, but I'll probably stick with that second version for now :)
2012-12-13 00:02:53	jfredett	so... 10^6 = 10^2 e^2t => 10^4 == e^2t => ln(10^4) == 2t => 4*ln(10) = 2t => t = 2*ln(10).
2012-12-13 00:03:21	jfredett	but double check / prove you can't have a second value for `t` in the reals!
2012-12-13 00:03:32	Z_Mass	Cool, thanks. I'll try that out

2012-12-14 23:21:18	@chance_z	intothev01d: yeah and it does a lot of the boilerplate for it
2012-12-14 23:21:30	@chance_z	like user registration is done, user models are written already
2012-12-14 23:21:49	@intothev01d	geez. wow yea that's awesome then
2012-12-14 23:21:59	@chance_z	it has mail built in
2012-12-14 23:22:00	@intothev01d	hmm
2012-12-14 23:22:02	@chance_z	and a basic 'roles' model for users
2012-12-14 23:22:29	@chance_z	registration can use mail to do registration confirmation
2012-12-14 23:23:49	@intothev01d	sounds like the way to go
2012-12-14 23:24:04	@chance_z	yeah.
2012-12-14 23:30:21	@chance_z	you should un-privatize the repo
2012-12-14 23:32:27	@intothev01d	yea i guess. i just didn't want someone to take the idea and go with it before I can test it otu
2012-12-14 23:32:29	@intothev01d	out*
2012-12-14 23:32:42	@intothev01d	prob wouldn't happen anyway but never know
2012-12-14 23:33:10	@intothev01d	i figure once I have it working properly and can get it up and going then I'll open it up
2012-12-14 23:33:27	@chance_z	yeah, suppose. idk i dont worry abou tpeople stealing stuff. i open source it for a reason ;D
2012-12-14 23:34:34	@intothev01d	yea i'd like to. it's more the idea of the site I'm worried about, not so much the code. I still plan on trying to apply to some of these startup places, like Y Combinator. If I make it there great, if not I'll still prob work on this and just open up the source eventually anyway
2012-12-14 23:36:15	@chance_z	i dont think its a big deal if someone knows my idea
2012-12-14 23:36:28	@intothev01d	I'm not saying the idea or anything is really particularly new but the approach, design, all that stuff is unique. i mean most things aren't new, it's just someone does it in a way people like and it catches on. that's kind of what I hope to do with this, but if it doesn't work out oh well
2012-12-14 23:37:00	@chance_z	i think tons of people have though of these ideas before and did it badly, so its not something to be afraid of.
2012-12-14 23:37:23	@chance_z	yeah, i mean thats why i open source things
2012-12-14 23:37:37	@chance_z	because then you could get a handful of great developers working on it with you and bam you've got something
2012-12-14 23:38:10	@chance_z	anyways brbz

2012-12-16 00:36:05	@chance	ive got the base down pretty much
2012-12-16 00:36:10	@chance	wasn't that hard actually
2012-12-16 00:36:27	@chance	basic commands are now something that can be implemented
2012-12-16 00:36:31	@chance	ive got an example
2012-12-16 00:36:41	@chance	atm the code is at github.com/ecnahc515/LPMCBot
2012-12-16 00:36:48	@chance	but im prob going to make a new name for it

2012-12-16 00:38:26	@chance	you cant have two repos with the same name
2012-12-16 00:38:26	Z_Mass	chance: Sorry, I meant the app that would handle having a .jpg go to feh and a .png to gimp for example
2012-12-16 00:38:30	@chance	you could delete the old lpmcbot
2012-12-16 00:39:08	@chance	Z_Mass: oh, you cant do that entirely at the DE level; often times you have to specify per application, ie: firefox
2012-12-16 00:39:22	@chance	howlden: you can just clone the bot and work on it
2012-12-16 00:39:27	@chance	if you want
2012-12-16 00:39:37	Z_Mass	chance: Don't have a DE ;) Just running i3wm
2012-12-16 00:39:42	@chance	try to get an idea
2012-12-16 00:39:54	@chance	Z_Mass: then what are you opening images from ?
2012-12-16 00:40:01	@chance	the terminal, or a file manager?
2012-12-16 00:40:23	Z_Mass	From chromium usually
2012-12-16 00:40:26	@chance	if i want to open an image, im usually in the terminal and I just navigate to it and say "feh myimage.png"
2012-12-16 00:40:34	@chance	thats at the application level
2012-12-16 00:40:45	@chance	sec.
2012-12-16 00:40:45	howlden	chance, yep, i'm going to try to understand what you wrote, and read thru the doc links you posted
2012-12-16 00:40:50	Z_Mass	Ya, that's no prob, it's more just if I click it right from the download window in chromium
2012-12-16 00:41:28	Z_Mass	Hmm, I'll have a look through the settings. Just thought there might be like a general purpose app that looks at an extension and loads the right app

2012-12-16 00:44:31	@chance	to give you an idea
2012-12-16 00:44:37	@chance	sure thing
2012-12-16 00:45:28	@chance	it might be hard to understand without comments, b ut the regex basically strips the target of who a person would be talking to if a name is mentioned
2012-12-16 00:46:35	@chance	ill add some comments, but im going to my friends house for now, talk to you guys later.

2012-12-16 18:47:50	Z_Mass	I think for it's purpose it's alright though. Who really wants to deal with irc and ports directly lol
2012-12-16 18:48:04	NoaHall	It initializes the directory as part of a package
2012-12-16 18:48:20	SirSkidmore	ahh

2012-12-16 19:30:33	Seewhen	aha
2012-12-16 19:30:35	tangentstorm	(for hunting mostly)
2012-12-16 19:30:35	SirSkidmore	tangentstorm: do you have assault weapons?
2012-12-16 19:30:41	tangentstorm	no
2012-12-16 19:30:47	SirSkidmore	There's no need for assault rifles/magazines
2012-12-16 19:31:01	SirSkidmore	The protection argument is moot at that
2012-12-16 19:31:43	tangentstorm	i don't own any guns myself but my dad and brother and even my mom have them :)
2012-12-16 19:33:02	SirSkidmore	My 12 year old brother owns ours technically
2012-12-16 19:33:04	SirSkidmore	heh
2012-12-16 19:33:10	Seewhen	what
2012-12-16 19:33:11	SirSkidmore	He's the only one who shoots
2012-12-16 19:33:24	SirSkidmore	should, not technically. My dad owns it
2012-12-16 19:33:27	Seewhen	oh
2012-12-16 19:33:46	Seewhen	i've never shot with one
2012-12-16 19:33:47	Seewhen	ever
2012-12-16 19:33:56	SirSkidmore	It's enjoyable
2012-12-16 19:33:57	Seewhen	our gun policy is very strict
2012-12-16 19:34:58	Seewhen	Could you go out, buy a gun and come home with it the same day?
2012-12-16 19:35:14	SirSkidmore	Yeah
2012-12-16 19:35:40	Seewhen	no wonder you have alot of shootings
2012-12-16 19:35:50	SirSkidmore	definitely
2012-12-16 19:36:01	Seewhen	if I wanted to get a gun.. i'd probobly have to wait 4-5 months
2012-12-16 19:36:13	Seewhen	even more
2012-12-16 19:36:20	SirSkidmore	Yeah, in New York it's about that to get a carry and conceal
2012-12-16 19:37:13	Seewhen	and you cant just own a gun in Norway.. you need a reason to have one. So you can only own a gun if ur either hunting or you're in some rifle club shooting at targets
2012-12-16 19:37:20	Seewhen	and you arent allowed to keep ammo at the house + the gun needs to be locked in
2012-12-16 19:37:24	SirSkidmore	You can have guns to here to have guns
2012-12-16 19:37:31	Seewhen	ye, that's what i dont get
2012-12-16 19:37:55	Seewhen	I saw a study a while back.. it said that most americans thinks its alright to shoot a guy if he is robbing ur house
2012-12-16 19:37:57	Seewhen	and kill him
2012-12-16 19:37:58	Seewhen	like
2012-12-16 19:37:58	Seewhen	what
2012-12-16 19:38:24	SirSkidmore	yeah
2012-12-16 19:38:27	Seewhen	imagine.. Norwegian police dont carry guns
2012-12-16 19:38:33	SirSkidmore	I live in a really rural area
2012-12-16 19:38:43	SirSkidmore	I only know a few people who don't own guns
2012-12-16 19:39:35	 *	tangentstorm is definitely going to rob Seewhen's house :)
2012-12-16 19:39:52	Seewhen	hehe
2012-12-16 19:39:52	Seewhen	gl
2012-12-16 19:39:52	SirSkidmore	We had a gun brought to school like 5 years ago
2012-12-16 19:39:53	SirSkidmore	by accident
2012-12-16 19:40:41	SirSkidmore	but we did have a kid bring a sword to school
2012-12-16 19:40:47	SirSkidmore	Like a legitimate sword
2012-12-16 19:40:54	Seewhen	>_<
2012-12-16 19:41:02	SirSkidmore	like two weeks ago
2012-12-16 19:41:05	SirSkidmore	pulled it on a kid
2012-12-16 19:42:25	SirSkidmore	Scarily, it was the same and only kid that I punched Freshman year
2012-12-16 19:43:32	Seewhen	lol
2012-12-16 19:43:44	SirSkidmore	he made fun of me all the time, and shoved me around a lot, so I punched him in the face, fractured his eyesocket, broke my knuckle, and knocked him out
2012-12-16 19:43:54	tangentstorm	that's hard core.
2012-12-16 19:44:02	Seewhen	that's the way to go
2012-12-16 19:44:14	SirSkidmore	People haven't really made fun of me since then
2012-12-16 19:44:32	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-16 19:47:24	SirSkidmore	so, yay
2012-12-16 19:47:57	Seewhen	What states do you guys live in?
2012-12-16 19:48:01	SirSkidmore	Indiana
2012-12-16 19:48:36	tangentstorm	texas
2012-12-16 19:49:14	Seewhen	cool
2012-12-16 19:49:44	SirSkidmore	Kinda, yeah
2012-12-16 19:49:54	Seewhen	Dont know much about either
2012-12-16 19:50:46	SirSkidmore	Indiana is "The cross roads of America"
2012-12-16 19:50:54	SirSkidmore	But there really isn't much to say
2012-12-16 19:51:04	Seewhen	How's the weather?

2012-12-16 20:04:15	SirSkidmore	like 80-90 F summers
2012-12-16 20:07:43	Seewhen	nice
2012-12-16 20:11:29	SirSkidmore	It's pretty great
2012-12-16 20:11:32	SirSkidmore	I like the cold
2012-12-16 20:12:14	Seewhen	ye, me too
2012-12-16 20:12:28	Seewhen	and i need snow
2012-12-16 20:13:07	SirSkidmore	I don't like the snow a whole lot
2012-12-16 20:13:22	SirSkidmore	simply because we're kinda isolated
2012-12-16 20:13:35	SirSkidmore	If I lived in town and could walk places, I would like it a lot more

2012-12-16 21:00:04	Z_Mass	NoaHall: What is the general way of using virtualenv with a git repo like that?
2012-12-16 21:00:25	SirSkidmore	mkdir ~/.virtualenvs/repo
2012-12-16 21:00:32	SirSkidmore	virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/repo
2012-12-16 21:00:44	SirSkidmore	source ~/.virtualenvs/repo/bin/activate
2012-12-16 21:01:01	SirSkidmore	I think keeping one env per project is good
2012-12-16 21:01:13	Z_Mass	SirSkidmore: Then I just cd up to the actual repo dir?
2012-12-16 21:01:25	SirSkidmore	mhm
2012-12-16 21:01:28	SirSkidmore	yeah
2012-12-16 21:01:39	SirSkidmore	once you source the virtualenv
2012-12-16 21:01:41	Z_Mass	I tried virtualenv LPMCBot but then it made the dir messy
2012-12-16 21:01:47	SirSkidmore	you can go anywhere
2012-12-16 21:01:56	SirSkidmore	yeah, keep all your envs in a hidden folder
2012-12-16 21:02:05	SirSkidmore	like ~/.virtualenv
2012-12-16 21:02:08	Z_Mass	Gotcha, that makes more sense
2012-12-16 21:02:12	SirSkidmore	then keep a env to match the repo
2012-12-16 21:02:21	SirSkidmore	but you don't actually ever really need to visit
2012-12-16 21:02:22	Z_Mass	is there a flag to specify the python version?
2012-12-16 21:02:31	SirSkidmore	that hidden directory
2012-12-16 21:02:35	SirSkidmore	virtualenv only works with 2
2012-12-16 21:02:38	SirSkidmore	I think
2012-12-16 21:02:47	Z_Mass	it defaulted to py3 for me
2012-12-16 21:02:50	SirSkidmore	ah
2012-12-16 21:03:05	SirSkidmore	just try python2
2012-12-16 21:03:06	SirSkidmore	as the comman
2012-12-16 21:03:08	Z_Mass	but I installed it using pip install, which on Arch is python3
2012-12-16 21:03:10	SirSkidmore	I dunno that one
2012-12-16 21:03:35	Z_Mass	Hmm, I'll just have a look at the man page

2012-12-16 21:44:37	SirSkidmore	Actually I would say make a branch

2012-12-16 21:44:46	SirSkidmore	than PR that
2012-12-16 21:45:05	Z_Mass	You still have to direct it to a branch from upstream
2012-12-16 21:45:15	SirSkidmore	oh
2012-12-16 21:45:16	SirSkidmore	yeah
2012-12-16 21:45:18	SirSkidmore	haha
2012-12-16 21:45:20	Z_Mass	:P
2012-12-16 21:46:05	Z_Mass	I'll just send to master I guess.
2012-12-16 21:50:53	intothev01d_m	I think master is working and develop is for new features
2012-12-16 21:50:55	intothev01d_m	I'd send to develop
2012-12-16 21:51:10	intothev01d_m	which I assume will get merged to working master if everything checks out ok
2012-12-16 21:51:11	Z_Mass	intothev01d_m: Can you change that after submiting the PR?
2012-12-16 21:51:18	SirSkidmore	intothev01d_m: did you look at my code? everything look allright?
2012-12-16 21:51:27	intothev01d_m	I don't guess it matters at this point, but for future reference
2012-12-16 21:51:55	intothev01d_m	prob check with chance on it to be sure how he wants to organize it though
2012-12-16 21:52:12	intothev01d_m	SirSkidmore, for the flask project?
2012-12-16 21:52:16	intothev01d_m	yea it's good
2012-12-16 21:52:22	SirSkidmore	coolio

2012-12-16 21:52:45	intothev01d_m	I just have to wrap my head around using flask-security
2012-12-16 21:53:01	intothev01d_m	not sure Z_Mass
2012-12-16 21:53:19	SirSkidmore	What do you want me to work on next?
2012-12-16 21:53:23	SirSkidmore	if anything
2012-12-16 21:54:22	intothev01d_m	hmm. well i need to take a look at how to use the flask-security stuff. if you want to read over docs for that and flask-mail etc. then when I get it up and going for something else you'll kind of have a good idea of what's going on.
2012-12-16 21:54:33	SirSkidmore	okay
2012-12-16 21:54:36	SirSkidmore	will-do
2012-12-16 21:55:14	Seewhen	any chance i can look at the code intothev01d_m? Curious about the flask framework ^^
2012-12-16 21:55:24	intothev01d_m	I've been concentrated on helping out in retro to get a working node js port of it going

2012-12-16 22:02:54	SirSkidmore	Yeah, I didn't like how it explained the testing though
2012-12-16 22:03:29	Z_Mass	Is this python2 as well?
2012-12-16 22:03:40	SirSkidmore	Yeah

2012-12-16 23:16:04	intothev01d_m	just was talking about how to organize the pull requests/pushes to the lpmcbot. said they should ask you how you want to handle those with what branch or whatever
2012-12-16 23:16:44	chance	pull requests are fine. im aiming to keep develop my branch for making significant changes
2012-12-16 23:16:53	chance	ill update my readme
2012-12-16 23:17:24	intothev01d_m	right, didn't know if you wanted a new branch for each feature or what
2012-12-16 23:22:12	chance	well they should be working in a branch, but the people working on it wouldn't have push access, so whereever they do it is up to them
2012-12-16 23:32:10	Z_Mass	chance: Did you have a chance to look at the PR I sent for LPMCBot?
2012-12-16 23:38:58	chance	thanks.
2012-12-16 23:39:01	chance	just merged it
2012-12-16 23:39:09	Z_Mass	Cool. np :)
2012-12-16 23:43:56	chance	what do you think of the new instructions?
2012-12-16 23:45:30	intothev01d_m	just b/c you said so, I'm going to make this thing order pizza :D
2012-12-16 23:45:52	chance	haha
2012-12-16 23:45:52	Z_Mass	Looks good. Altough if someone is on arch and not using virtualenv, they will need to use pip2
2012-12-16 23:46:03	chance	i alias it
2012-12-16 23:46:03	chance	if you use arch
2012-12-16 23:46:09	chance	you better fucking know how to do this shit
2012-12-16 23:46:15	Z_Mass	Fair enough ;)
2012-12-16 23:46:30	chance	i mean its fairly obvious if you type 'python' in the arch wiki, it says python 3 ;P
2012-12-16 23:46:35	chance	i use arch :D
2012-12-16 23:47:25	Z_Mass	Same, I went full circle. I was using arch in september, then went to mint, ubuntu and now back to arch lol
2012-12-16 23:47:31	intothev01d_m	see yall later
2012-12-16 23:47:36	chance	intothev01d_m: cya

2012-12-16 23:47:55	chance	i think im going to begin with configuration stuffs for the bot
2012-12-16 23:48:05	chance	making the config stuff more seperated out
2012-12-16 23:48:22	Z_Mass	Ya I was going to ask you if you planned on using env vars for the channels and what not
2012-12-16 23:48:43	chance	i was thinking just a config file
2012-12-16 23:48:46	chance	python or yaml maybe
2012-12-16 23:50:12	Z_Mass	Never used yaml, but if you do that then you have to deal with people changing and commiting it
2012-12-16 23:50:35	chance	nah
2012-12-16 23:50:45	chance	gitignore config.py or settings.py
2012-12-16 23:50:52	chance	and just distribute config.py.dist or settings.py.dist
2012-12-16 23:51:08	chance	instructions: cp config.py.dist config.py and adjust settings as needed
2012-12-16 23:51:44	Z_Mass	ya, that sounds easy enough
2012-12-16 23:51:55	chance	its pretty standard
2012-12-16 23:53:59	Z_Mass	I'm trying to remember that site jfreddet used to link. It had a section on seperating config from the app
2012-12-16 23:54:55	chance	i know what id do
2012-12-16 23:55:00	chance	its just a matter of whats easier for newbies
2012-12-16 23:55:03	chance	prob a normal python file
2012-12-16 23:55:27	Z_Mass	I guess that way you don't have to explain env vars
2012-12-16 23:58:04	Z_Mass	So what happened to SlimTim anyways?
2012-12-16 23:58:55	chance	idk
2012-12-16 23:58:55	chance	got busyh
2012-12-16 23:58:55	chance	busy
2012-12-17 00:01:22	Z_Mass	ya it's been quite a while since I've seen him.
2012-12-17 00:02:17	Z_Mass	Does the bot respond to  any commands atm?
2012-12-17 00:03:55	chance	it responds to hi, hello and hey if you say LPMCBot: hi
2012-12-17 00:03:55	chance	or hey
2012-12-17 00:03:56	chance	ect
2012-12-17 00:03:58	chance	lol
2012-12-17 00:04:54	Z_Mass	oh ok, I had tried that without the colon before, that's why it did nothing
2012-12-17 00:05:13	Z_Mass	Is that the syntax for future commands? Or will it use !command as well?
2012-12-17 00:07:15	chance	its regex based
2012-12-17 00:07:25	chance	so it doesnt really matter
2012-12-17 00:07:25	chance	:DD
2012-12-17 00:07:35	chance	Z_Mass: its colon or comma :)
2012-12-17 00:07:55	chance	if you can represent the command as a regex, it'll work :)
2012-12-17 00:09:21	Z_Mass	Nice, so each command is a class, and it will have a string named regex which is the name of the command essentially?
2012-12-17 00:09:48	Z_Mass	Just trying to figure out the organization of it all. 
2012-12-17 00:16:39	chance	yeah.
2012-12-17 00:16:49	chance	The registerCommand decorator registers the command
2012-12-17 00:16:54	chance	look at that to get an idea
2012-12-17 00:17:22	chance	also look at the commander.py file towards the end of the Commander class
2012-12-17 00:17:28	chance	end of the privmsg function
2012-12-17 00:17:58	chance	it goes through registered commands until it hits a match, it then calls that function
2012-12-17 00:18:05	chance	it hits the first match, i'll add priority later.
2012-12-17 00:18:19	chance	so atm priority is the order they're declared in commands.py i guess lol
2012-12-17 00:19:25	Z_Mass	So all commands are going in commands.py for now?
2012-12-17 00:20:16	chance	yeah
2012-12-17 00:20:22	Z_Mass	I really like this setup, the old bot was getting a little to big to not have any classes
2012-12-17 00:20:25	chance	well technically it doesnt have to
2012-12-17 00:20:40	chance	you could put a command anywhere so long as you import register command
2012-12-17 00:20:43	chance	and use it
2012-12-17 00:20:47	chance	config file stuff is pushed
2012-12-17 00:20:50	chance	its very simple
2012-12-17 00:20:55	chance	but its usable i thinks
2012-12-17 00:20:56	chance	anyways brb
2012-12-17 00:21:14	Z_Mass	k
2012-12-17 00:33:24	howlden	morning
2012-12-17 00:34:02	chance	howlden: morning
2012-12-17 00:35:20	howlden	hey chance, just starting reading what u added
2012-12-17 00:35:52	chance	good stuff
2012-12-17 00:35:56	chance	let me know if you have questions/
2012-12-17 00:36:34	howlden	ok great
2012-12-17 00:56:43	howlden	chance, my main friction point is just the regex right now. i learned the basics yesterday and i understand some the patterns in yours, but i can't 'reverse engineer' it yet, what would be an example input sequence, and matched output ?

2012-12-17 22:47:44	Z_Mass	What would you guys say is better style for c++? "if( x != y )" or "if (x != y)"
2012-12-17 22:55:36	intothev01d_m	those look the same, amd i missing something?
2012-12-17 22:55:52	intothev01d_m	or is it just the spacing of the parenthasies
2012-12-17 22:56:02	Z_Mass	Ya I'm just talking space wise
2012-12-17 22:56:38	Z_Mass	intothev01d_m: ^
2012-12-17 22:56:56	intothev01d_m	um i don't really know honestly. i'd have to find a style guide for c++, but I prefer less space imo
2012-12-17 22:59:23	Z_Mass	Ya I read part of the Google style guide, I don't remember what they said though.
2012-12-17 22:59:29	chance	2nd one imo
2012-12-17 23:02:36	Z_Mass	chance: That seems to be the preferred style for google as well
2012-12-17 23:04:45	intothev01d_m	what do they prefer 1st or 2nd?
2012-12-17 23:04:52	intothev01d_m	do you have a link to the guide?

2012-12-17 23:07:50	intothev01d_m	it just takes up room really
2012-12-17 23:10:03	Z_Mass	lol, I think that's what I prefer too
2012-12-17 23:10:54	Z_Mass	For reading someone elses code, I'll take either, just not "if(x != y)"

2012-12-17 23:47:21	tangentstorm	depends whether it's syntax highlighted or not for me
2012-12-17 23:47:58	tangentstorm	i started putting extra spaces in within the past couple months. not really sure why.
2012-12-17 23:48:08	intothev01d_m	that's true too
2012-12-17 23:48:16	intothev01d_m	without the highlighting more space helps
2012-12-17 23:48:27	tangentstorm	i think maybe when i started reading oberon code.
2012-12-17 23:48:47	tangentstorm	it's like case-sensitive pascal and all the keywords are in caps.

2012-12-19 19:20:48	SirSkidmore	is my current set up
2012-12-19 19:21:23	jfredett	nice -- multimonitor support is good then?
2012-12-19 19:21:29	SirSkidmore	yeah
2012-12-19 19:21:39	SirSkidmore	I'm still tweaking it right now
2012-12-19 19:21:49	SirSkidmore	but its multihead is similar to XMonad: 1 view per monitor, period
2012-12-19 19:21:59	jfredett	I'm going to be picking up a third soonish. I thought about using Awesome, but I stumbled on subtle and thought, "This would be nice."
2012-12-19 19:22:11	SirSkidmore	It's got a strict tagging sysem though, and so you can't move files around willy-nilly
2012-12-19 19:22:14	SirSkidmore	windows*
2012-12-19 19:22:29	SirSkidmore	like if you have your third view set for terminals
2012-12-19 19:22:35	jfredett	yah, I never loved that about xmonad, but tbh, I never found myself desparately wanting to depart from it
2012-12-19 19:22:37	SirSkidmore	you can't move your terminals to the fifth view for movies
2012-12-19 19:23:11	SirSkidmore	Although I need to set it up so I can run certain applications in a terminal in separate views
2012-12-19 19:23:19	jfredett	hunh -- you can have more than one display for the same thing though, right? Eg I want two monitors to edit terminals on, one for movies/chrome
2012-12-19 19:24:07	SirSkidmore	Er
2012-12-19 19:24:19	SirSkidmore	You can probably set your tags up to handle it
2012-12-19 19:24:19	jfredett	I might not be wording that well
2012-12-19 19:25:10	SirSkidmore	I need to figure out how to exclude certain programs from tags, like ncmpcpp
2012-12-19 19:25:17	jfredett	in xmonad, I usually had two screens for coding, one for 'stuff' (usually to my right), and the center was the actual code to edit, the left was like, server logs and tests and stuff
2012-12-19 19:25:26	jfredett	mostly server logs, I was doing haskell then.
2012-12-19 19:25:30	jfredett	well
2012-12-19 19:25:32	jfredett	logs
2012-12-19 19:25:39	jfredett	not really server logs
2012-12-19 19:25:40	jfredett	okay -- type errors
2012-12-19 19:25:43	jfredett	_lots_ of type errors
2012-12-19 19:25:44	SirSkidmore	so even though ncmpcpp is in urxvt I can keep it in a music view
2012-12-19 19:25:58	jfredett	i see, so you just have to tag stuff cleverly.
2012-12-19 19:26:03	SirSkidmore	yeah
2012-12-19 19:26:06	SirSkidmore	shit
2012-12-19 19:26:13	SirSkidmore	I have to go get my meds before the pharmacy closes
2012-12-19 19:26:16	jfredett	interesting. I'm excited to see how it works out.

2012-12-19 19:26:46	jfredett	Sometime saturday/sunday we should do a google hangout to plan up Alice (or whatever her name is)
2012-12-19 19:26:54	SirSkidmore	For sure
2012-12-19 19:27:02	jfredett	errybodys invited to come too

2012-12-19 19:28:21	@intothev01d	what is the project about again?
2012-12-19 19:30:25	jfredett	a CLI email client.
2012-12-19 19:30:33	jfredett	like mutt, but not total garbage.

2012-12-19 19:31:12	@intothev01d	oh cool
2012-12-19 19:31:22	jfredett	I'm hoping to do a little experimenting w/ storage formats w/ it too, because maildir and mbox are also terribad.
2012-12-19 19:34:19	@intothev01d	you're going to write it in clojure correct?
2012-12-19 19:34:48	jfredett	yah

2012-12-20 21:22:27	Z_Mass	I put all the code, but basically it should be writing out all lines of a vector<string> to the file
2012-12-20 21:22:32	@intothev01d	you sure the parameters there are giving you the right location for it?
2012-12-20 21:22:42	tangentstorm	intothev01d: i got the tests running for retro.js. unfortunately, they all passed :/
2012-12-20 21:22:43	@intothev01d	?
2012-12-20 21:22:52	@intothev01d	that good or bad?
2012-12-20 21:23:34	@intothev01d	Z_Mass, just try writing anything there

2012-12-20 21:24:25	tangentstorm	intothev01d: in general it's good, but it's bad in this case because i had hoped the tests would expose whatever's wrong with my version :)

2012-12-20 21:38:22	@intothev01d	could be

2012-12-20 21:39:22	@intothev01d	weird, looks like it would work though
2012-12-20 21:41:02	Z_Mass	Ya it's not changing anything.. The data is in the struct after calling create_profile, but then inside write_profile it's blank
2012-12-20 21:41:26	@intothev01d	so it must not be able to do that
2012-12-20 21:42:17	@intothev01d	or well i mean, so you store it in a profile variable and then pass that to the write_profile now?
2012-12-20 21:42:17	Z_Mass	Pass a struct?
2012-12-20 21:42:41	Z_Mass	Ya, I broke up write(create()) into p = create, write(p)
2012-12-20 21:42:52	Z_Mass	same results as the single line
2012-12-20 21:43:02	@intothev01d	ok
2012-12-20 21:43:22	@intothev01d	profile p prints nothing as soon as you pass it to write_profile?
2012-12-20 21:44:22	Z_Mass	yep, it has data inside main, but then in write_profile it seems empty
2012-12-20 21:44:37	Z_Mass	I'll try passing by reference, but I didn't think that was needed
2012-12-20 21:47:46	Z_Mass	It almost seems like accessing p inside write_profile is causing it to crash

2012-12-20 21:52:25	@intothev01d	store it first

2012-12-20 21:55:05	@intothev01d	lol
2012-12-20 21:55:23	@intothev01d	but now it directly references that object so no worries
2012-12-20 21:55:25	@intothev01d	so long as you didn't need a copy
2012-12-20 21:55:59	@intothev01d	it won't matter it looks like since it copies the contents of p to a vector anyway
2012-12-20 21:56:52	Z_Mass	Ya I never really change the contents of it
2012-12-20 21:57:03	@intothev01d	k
2012-12-20 21:58:13	@intothev01d	did you try just before that passsing it by reference like void write_profile(profile &p) ?
2012-12-20 21:58:26	Z_Mass	Ya I tried that
2012-12-20 21:58:31	@intothev01d	didnt work huh?
2012-12-20 21:58:48	Z_Mass	It works without the struct keyword though. But no, plain ref didn't work for some reason
2012-12-20 21:58:55	Z_Mass	I find it odd that it let it compile though
2012-12-20 21:58:57	@intothev01d	i have no clue really, someone that knows more than me could prob explain it

2012-12-20 21:59:36	Z_Mass	heh
2012-12-20 22:00:43	@intothev01d	wait i think i know, when you passed by reference did you use -> instead of .?
2012-12-20 22:00:48	@intothev01d	like p->variable
2012-12-20 22:01:04	@intothev01d	i could be way off b/c i think that's just for pointers and such
2012-12-20 22:01:45	Z_Mass	When I did plain ref I still used .
2012-12-20 22:01:58	Z_Mass	I think -> is strictly for pointers
2012-12-20 22:02:11	Z_Mass	Because the compiler only complained about it when I switched to a pointer
2012-12-20 22:02:33	@intothev01d	hm yea. i dunno why it works like that
2012-12-20 22:02:53	Z_Mass	I wonder if just using a real class with only public members would of solved my problems lol
2012-12-20 22:03:05	@intothev01d	you should probably ask zzyyzz when he's back in here, I think he works with C++ and he has the lib A* project
2012-12-20 22:03:13	@intothev01d	maybe
2012-12-20 22:03:22	@intothev01d	i mean, a struct is a public class, so I don't know
2012-12-20 22:03:33	@intothev01d	he'll prob know why though
2012-12-20 22:04:20	Z_Mass	This is just for my class next semester, the teacher is an old C programmer and seems to be teaching C in C++ lol
2012-12-20 22:04:43	@intothev01d	ouch
2012-12-20 22:04:51	Z_Mass	The lab said to create a struct to store data and use fwrite and fread to store it
2012-12-20 22:05:14	@intothev01d	yea thats some C stuff right there
2012-12-20 22:05:33	--	SirSkidmore is now known as SirSkids|Zzz
2012-12-20 22:05:57	Z_Mass	Ya, we used Allegro this semester, and next semester were going to use SDL, both C libraries.. Would be so much nicer if we could use something modern like SFML2
2012-12-20 22:09:43	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: how about zengl.org? :)
2012-12-20 22:10:18	Z_Mass	intothev01d: If I have a function which returns a profile pointer, does it need to be created as a pointer in the function?
2012-12-20 22:10:26	tangentstorm	oh, zzyyzzxx is the a* guy? :) i didn't realize that.
2012-12-20 22:10:33	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: Checking that out now
2012-12-20 22:11:27	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: i started using it this weekend after sdl caused us too much pain and heartache. not as object-oriented as i'd like but it's pretty nice.
2012-12-20 22:11:44	tangentstorm	and not written in c :)
2012-12-20 22:12:04	Z_Mass	So it's in pascal but has a C++ binding?
2012-12-20 22:12:27	Z_Mass	meaning you can use it in c++?
2012-12-20 22:13:19	tangentstorm	yep
2012-12-20 22:13:59	 *	tangentstorm thinks again about registering dangrightiusepascal.com
2012-12-20 22:14:04	Z_Mass	Would going from c->pascal->c++ cause any slow downs?
2012-12-20 22:14:31	Z_Mass	Or is it not using sdl?
2012-12-20 22:14:34	tangentstorm	no, it's all just compiled code
2012-12-20 22:14:45	tangentstorm	i think it uses opengl  under the hood
2012-12-20 22:14:52	Z_Mass	gotcha, that's interesting
2012-12-20 22:16:52	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML/wiki/Project%3A-Groogy%27s-Development-Environment
2012-12-20 22:17:25	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: my game's not much to look at but you can see what it does with rotated bitmaps (very smooth/anti-aliased): http://imgur.com/a/Hvoq7#10
2012-12-20 22:17:37	Z_Mass	It's for the Ruby version of SFML, but it lets you update the code and see the change in the game without reloading anything
2012-12-20 22:17:54	tangentstorm	oh that's cool
2012-12-20 22:18:21	tangentstorm	i wrote a livecoding environment like that for python... i should hook it up to this game engine
2012-12-20 22:18:46	tangentstorm	although i guess that's kind of also what i was trying to do with retro over the weekend. just didn't get that far.
2012-12-20 22:19:56	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: The defender game? Is that the img you were linking?
2012-12-20 22:20:01	 *	tangentstorm wonders where the code for livepy went...
2012-12-20 22:20:43	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: yeah. we were going to make a text adventure in #retro but that turned into a sprite engine, and then we had all kinds of problems with the sdl bindings... so i finally just gave up and tried zengl.
2012-12-20 22:22:20	Z_Mass	Looks cool, is that using the vm you guys have?
2012-12-20 22:24:54	Z_Mass	intothev01d: I just realized I probably could of solved my problem by having a global profile struct -_-
2012-12-20 22:27:04	chance	globals are bad mkay!
2012-12-20 22:27:43	Z_Mass	chance: I agree, but for these silly school things sometimes it's easier
2012-12-20 22:28:34	Z_Mass	I overdesigned the heck out of some of my labs and all I got was "Excellent effort" lol
2012-12-20 22:29:01	chance	when i over design shit its because it makes it easier to reuse shit ;D
2012-12-20 22:29:25	chance	as any programmer should do ;D
2012-12-20 22:29:39	Z_Mass	fair enough :P
2012-12-20 22:29:43	chance	like my flask website
2012-12-20 22:29:50	chance	heh
2012-12-20 22:30:27	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: no, it's not running on ngaro yet. when it does, it'll run as native code with zengl or in the browser with (maybe?) melonjs

2012-12-21 01:11:52	@intothev01d	tangentstorm, i'm not running it either
2012-12-21 01:22:38	tangentstorm	dun-dun-duuuuuuuuuuuuun.
2012-12-21 01:25:28	Z_Mass	You guys have any idea why p->first_name = *it++; would cause a segfault?
2012-12-21 01:25:55	Z_Mass	p is a struct, and it is a vector<string>::const_iterator
2012-12-21 01:26:47	@intothev01d	my guess is some sort of invalid access, like nothing exists there maybe
2012-12-21 01:27:24	Z_Mass	Oh my bad, that's not what's crashing it
2012-12-21 01:27:47	Z_Mass	p->first_name = prompt("First name: ");
2012-12-21 01:28:01	Z_Mass	After I enter a string and hit enter, it crashes
2012-12-21 01:33:11	@intothev01d	I've literally never seen prompt before, have you just tried cout <<  "First name: "; then cin >> p->firstname; ?
2012-12-21 01:34:27	Z_Mass	intothev01d: I just wrapped that up in a function :P
2012-12-21 01:34:45	@intothev01d	try it without the function maybe?
2012-12-21 01:34:50	@intothev01d	still the same result?
2012-12-21 01:35:14	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: post the actual code :)
2012-12-21 01:36:03	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: one sec
2012-12-21 01:37:42	Z_Mass	https://gist.github.com/4351070#file-main-cpp-L74
2012-12-21 01:38:57	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Still crashes
2012-12-21 01:39:32	@intothev01d	can you set p without input and see if it has any value after setting it?
2012-12-21 01:39:34	Z_Mass	prompt is at 157. It's only a few lines, I don't think it should be a problem. Just cleans up the code
2012-12-21 01:40:53	Z_Mass	hmm, interesting, it crashes without outputing anything
2012-12-21 01:42:26	Z_Mass	I bet if I put this in a few classes and avoided pointers it would work, but then that's pretty far from a struct + fwrite/fread..
2012-12-21 01:42:52	tangentstorm	hmm. my intuition is saying you've got a null pointer somewhere, but i don't see it at a casual glance. step through it with a debugger.
2012-12-21 01:43:16	tangentstorm	this right here is why i hate C :)
2012-12-21 01:43:40	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: It's created one line above, and I'm setting, not accessing it
2012-12-21 01:44:08	tangentstorm	oh right
2012-12-21 01:44:36	tangentstorm	yeah you're just creating a pointer to some random place in memory and then writing stuff to it
2012-12-21 01:44:41	@intothev01d	i think it should be profile p = *create_profile();
2012-12-21 01:45:58	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: line 72 ... you've created a pointer but not initialized it or allocated any ram for it
2012-12-21 01:46:47	tangentstorm	so it's just some arbitrary location, and now you're writing a value to an offset from that location. hence the segfault.
2012-12-21 01:47:00	Z_Mass	hmm
2012-12-21 01:47:19	Z_Mass	So I need profile *p = profile ?
2012-12-21 01:47:41	Z_Mass	I've never really used pointers to structs before
2012-12-21 01:47:56	@intothev01d	profile *p = new profile I would thing
2012-12-21 01:47:58	@intothev01d	think
2012-12-21 01:48:09	tangentstorm	you said "and I'm setting, not accessing it"... it's always *writing* to a null pointer that's going to blow up your system. reading a null pointer just gives you garbage.
2012-12-21 01:48:55	Z_Mass	ofcourse, forgot about new for a second..
2012-12-21 01:49:03	tangentstorm	why not just make it a class?
2012-12-21 01:49:13	@intothev01d	don't forget about delete for that as well at the end of main
2012-12-21 01:49:21	@intothev01d	delete p; to clear up the memory for it
2012-12-21 01:49:45	Z_Mass	got I hate manually managing pointers
2012-12-21 01:49:47	Z_Mass	*god
2012-12-21 01:49:59	@intothev01d	pointer to god :D

2012-12-21 01:50:05	@intothev01d	lol
2012-12-21 01:50:17	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: http://www.slctech.org/~mackay/game20312/game20312.lab1.html part 4 -_-
2012-12-21 01:50:22	Z_Mass	haha :P
2012-12-21 01:50:33	tangentstorm	the sad part is the compiler could easily have found this for you, but it apparently didn't :/
2012-12-21 01:51:13	tangentstorm	oh
2012-12-21 01:51:16	tangentstorm	well why not just use a struct then?
2012-12-21 01:51:57	Z_Mass	I am :)
2012-12-21 01:52:00	Z_Mass	profile is a struct
2012-12-21 01:52:05	tangentstorm	no you're not
2012-12-21 01:52:13	tangentstorm	you're using a pointer to a struct
2012-12-21 01:52:25	tangentstorm	why does it have to be dynamic?
2012-12-21 01:52:41	Z_Mass	Ya, I started out with no pointers, but for some reason the data didn't follow the struct around
2012-12-21 01:53:05	Z_Mass	Ok, so now I get prompted for all the values, but it still crashes.. 
2012-12-21 01:53:23	tangentstorm	okay, well.. there's probably *another* null pointer problem :)
2012-12-21 01:53:55	Z_Mass	Should I be able to do profile *p = create_profile(); in main?
2012-12-21 01:54:20	@intothev01d	yep
2012-12-21 01:54:20	Z_Mass	or will I need to do "profile *p = new profile; p = create_profile();"
2012-12-21 01:54:50	tangentstorm	no, you only have to allocate it once
2012-12-21 01:54:53	@intothev01d	no it should be like you have it
2012-12-21 01:54:54	tangentstorm	when it's actually created
2012-12-21 01:55:29	Z_Mass	gotcha
2012-12-21 01:55:44	Z_Mass	Back to the debuger then 
2012-12-21 01:56:40	tangentstorm	char* and string the same type?
2012-12-21 01:56:53	tangentstorm	ARE char* and string the same type?
2012-12-21 01:57:25	Z_Mass	no
2012-12-21 01:57:38	Z_Mass	char* is c-style, string is from the stl
2012-12-21 01:57:41	tangentstorm	then look at profile_name
2012-12-21 01:57:59	Z_Mass	I'm crashing in my i_to_str function now
2012-12-21 01:58:22	tangentstorm	    profile_name = argv[2];
2012-12-21 01:58:46	Z_Mass	Ya that works fine
2012-12-21 01:58:52	Z_Mass	I've already cout debuged it :P
2012-12-21 01:59:06	@intothev01d	you mean str_to_i?
2012-12-21 01:59:13	tangentstorm	so they're the same type with different names?
2012-12-21 02:00:20	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: std::string handles the pointer stuff, and I believe it has a few more methods
2012-12-21 02:00:23	tangentstorm	 char* str; // sprintf will not take a string
2012-12-21 02:00:46	tangentstorm	if they're not compatible types, then how are you able to assign them to each other?
2012-12-21 02:00:58	Z_Mass	They're not always interchangable. You can do string = char* but not char* = string
2012-12-21 02:01:12	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Nope, its the other one below it
2012-12-21 02:01:45	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: well in any case, you are again creating this char* str and not assigning it to anything
2012-12-21 02:01:47	Z_Mass	intothev01d: It's called in serialize
2012-12-21 02:01:59	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: I tried char* str = "" and same thing

2012-12-21 02:03:03	@intothev01d	ok nvm
2012-12-21 02:03:12	tangentstorm	no..
2012-12-21 02:03:23	tangentstorm	is sprintf's
2012-12-21 02:03:27	chance	hamper2: tom-'aytoe' or tom-'ahtoe'?

2012-12-21 02:03:49	chance	oops >.<
2012-12-21 02:04:03	tangentstorm	is part of sprintf's job to check whether the first parameter is null, and if so allocate memory to it?
2012-12-21 02:04:14	chance	hamper2 is an irc bot my friend write, largely similar to where i got the base for the current lpmcbot
2012-12-21 02:04:53	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: I'm not sure, but if I set it to " " shouldn't it have memory allocated
2012-12-21 02:05:03	 *	tangentstorm would say toh-MAY-to... not TOM-ay-to :)
2012-12-21 02:05:06	@intothev01d	will it let you pass ret.c_str()?
2012-12-21 02:05:23	@intothev01d	and avoid the char* str all together?
2012-12-21 02:05:50	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Good idea, I'll try that
2012-12-21 02:05:53	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: you can't just make a pointer and stick stuff into wherever it points to. actually allocate some memory before calling sprintf :)
2012-12-21 02:06:07	tangentstorm	or that
2012-12-21 02:06:29	Z_Mass	c_str() returns a const pointer
2012-12-21 02:06:36	Z_Mass	or const char* 
2012-12-21 02:07:03	@intothev01d	so that doesn't work in sprintf?
2012-12-21 02:07:04	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: But char* text = "Hi"; is legal c
2012-12-21 02:07:07	chance	anyone want to write a plugin for hamper2? i have a fun idea that'll be not too hard that i'd like to work with someone on maybe :D
2012-12-21 02:07:25	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Nope, because it puts the formated string into the first arg
2012-12-21 02:08:09	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/sprintf/
2012-12-21 02:08:15	tangentstorm	The buffer should be large enough to contain the resulting string.
2012-12-21 02:09:19	tangentstorm	maybe the compiler does something magic with string literals so   char* text = "hi"; works but it can't be some magic thing
2012-12-21 02:09:33	Z_Mass	Got it! char* str = new char;
2012-12-21 02:09:44	Z_Mass	no idea why I can't do it the other way though
2012-12-21 02:09:45	tangentstorm	probably "hi" is allocated at a static position in ram and text just points to that static position so it all works out
2012-12-21 02:10:13	Z_Mass	now to see if I can go the other way, and read from that file
2012-12-21 02:11:44	@intothev01d	i know this seems crazy but I think people should start out learning this stuff with pointers early on, not the other way around. just because then you get to see what the computer is doing with memory addressing and all
2012-12-21 02:12:05	 *	tangentstorm agrees 100%
2012-12-21 02:12:23	@intothev01d	it would have blown my damn mind in my first csci class but… in the end sometimes jumping in the deep end is worth it
2012-12-21 02:12:25	tangentstorm	that's actually one reason i like retro.
2012-12-21 02:12:38	tangentstorm	it's really really close to the machine.
2012-12-21 02:12:53	@intothev01d	i really enjoyed my computer architecture class this semester
2012-12-21 02:12:53	tangentstorm	forth in general is that way, but with retro the machine is very simple.

2012-12-21 02:13:54	chance	go go go
2012-12-21 02:14:30	@intothev01d	no but that is awesome
2012-12-21 02:14:54	chance	takes a while to get it but you get it
2012-12-21 02:15:11	tangentstorm	i found out a book from one of those videos of guys who made a computer in minecraft
2012-12-21 02:15:23	tangentstorm	er about that book
2012-12-21 02:15:44	tangentstorm	chance: crazy for them to do this, but interesting.
2012-12-21 02:16:34	@intothev01d	what would be the best choice there for OS?
2012-12-21 02:16:55	@intothev01d	considering the limitations
2012-12-21 02:17:29	chance	idk
2012-12-21 02:17:33	chance	centOS/ubuntu/debian?
2012-12-21 02:18:03	@intothev01d	yea those are all options, just didnt' know which version or choice out of those is good
2012-12-21 02:18:03	tangentstorm	man i have no idea how i would offer this at those prices.
2012-12-21 02:18:36	 *	tangentstorm needs to come up with a new business plan.
2012-12-21 02:19:33	tangentstorm	i use debian in really tiny places.
2012-12-21 02:20:53	tangentstorm	"Technical support is only available via email." that's probably part of it... hrm.
2012-12-21 02:20:53	@intothev01d	im not familiar enough to know much of any differences between the distros. I've only ever used ubuntu really. is it similar or?
2012-12-21 02:21:25	chance	http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1569em/a_letter_to_santa_from_my_brothers_5th_grade_class/
2012-12-21 02:21:43	Z_Mass	I'm guessing ubuntu will have newer software by default
2012-12-21 02:21:57	chance	its basically release cycles and support
2012-12-21 02:22:08	Z_Mass	I may be wrong but i don't think ubuntu server differs much from plain debian
2012-12-21 02:22:13	chance	so basically ubuntu LTS releases get supported for 5 years after they're released
2012-12-21 02:22:43	@intothev01d	well i pick 12.04 lts then since it will have the longest support
2012-12-21 02:22:53	chance	its packages are the newest stable packages on the ubuntu branch, and the current release branches get fixes first, old releases (older LTS releases) get security fixes only.
2012-12-21 02:23:24	chance	debian releases are frozen, they release a new build whenever the last builds final bugs are fixed
2012-12-21 02:23:46	Z_Mass	I wonder if they let you upgrade these when stuff like a new lts is out
2012-12-21 02:24:04	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: you have root access
2012-12-21 02:24:06	chance	and by bugs i mean all bugs
2012-12-21 02:24:07	Z_Mass	I was never a fan of using apt to do a dist-upgrade
2012-12-21 02:24:13	tangentstorm	oh
2012-12-21 02:24:23	chance	and then they drop support for the last release after a couple months im psure
2012-12-21 02:25:21	chance	Z_Mass: you have to either dist-upgrade or rebuild, in any case, if you wanted to do an upgrade it would need to be dist upgrade or migration anyways.
2012-12-21 02:25:54	@intothev01d	it says they are at capacity but fixing it asap?
2012-12-21 02:26:14	chance	idk, it worked for a few of my friends earlier today im psure
2012-12-21 02:26:19	chance	i just found out about it
2012-12-21 02:26:24	chance	i have a VPS so meh
2012-12-21 02:26:36	chance	didnt try xD
2012-12-21 02:26:53	@intothev01d	i've been using aws free tier but why not have more free space
2012-12-21 02:26:55	Z_Mass	chance: The signup page says the chunk managament offers "reimage and chose another os"
2012-12-21 02:26:56	@intothev01d	lol
2012-12-21 02:27:26	@intothev01d	yea i saw that. so you can change it anyway so I guess the choice didn't matter much to me after all
2012-12-21 02:27:30	Z_Mass	lol yep
2012-12-21 02:27:31	@intothev01d	http://chunkhost.com/r/Elysium
2012-12-21 02:27:57	chance	Z_Mass: that would consist of a rebuild, which means you would be doing some type of migration of your data if you want to keep it
2012-12-21 02:28:06	chance	or if its stored in llvm or block storage its easier
2012-12-21 02:28:13	chance	depends
2012-12-21 02:28:37	tangentstorm	hmm. doesn't say anything about not using irc bots
2012-12-21 02:28:38	chance	it would be the same if you just wanted to upgrade your own desktop with a CD, you'd have to do something partitionwise or back up some configs ect.
2012-12-21 02:28:53	@intothev01d	oh i guess that link just takes you to the main page
2012-12-21 02:28:54	chance	what do you guys think of hamper2?

2012-12-21 02:29:40	Z_Mass	not that I have any idea what I'll use it for anyways lol

2012-12-21 02:30:35	chance	oops
2012-12-21 02:30:44	chance	i didnt load dice
2012-12-21 02:31:00	chance	anyways
2012-12-21 02:31:07	chance	i want to write a config reloader for hamper
2012-12-21 02:31:25	chance	and that would involve a lot of post initial registration plugin function writing
2012-12-21 02:31:34	chance	to make it so you can load plugins which haven't been registered yet
2012-12-21 02:32:05	tangentstorm	i don't believe it's a bot :)
2012-12-21 02:32:23	@intothev01d	hamper looks a lot like lpmcbot though, why not just add whatever hamper has in to lpmcbot

2012-12-21 02:42:34	chance	Z_Mass: uhh
2012-12-21 02:42:39	chance	let me check
2012-12-21 02:42:56	chance	im not a part of the group
2012-12-21 02:43:13	Z_Mass	It's been moved into LearnProgramming
2012-12-21 02:43:54	chance	ah
2012-12-21 02:44:04	chance	well firstly tangentstorm is probably the one to ask
2012-12-21 02:45:02	chance	but i think for push access you need to be a member of the learnprogramming org
2012-12-21 02:45:14	chance	which gives push access to all the repos
2012-12-21 02:45:21	chance	thats fine, im not worried
2012-12-21 02:45:36	chance	but if you want to have the learnprogramming stuff added, id push to your repo and pull request, or ask tangentstorm
2012-12-21 02:46:26	Z_Mass	Oh ok, I'll just fork it for now then
2012-12-21 02:46:46	chance	yeah prob best
2012-12-21 02:47:24	chance	Z_Mass: so where are you from?
2012-12-21 02:47:49	Z_Mass	Eastern Ontario
2012-12-21 02:48:18	Z_Mass	Crysler, ON specifically. But I live in Cornwall, ON now, just across the bridge from Masena, NY

2012-12-21 02:49:39	Z_Mass	Game programming would be alright, but I think I'd like to work on web apps 
2012-12-21 02:52:22	chance	kewl =]
2012-12-21 02:52:24	Z_Mass	Something like Shopify would be cool, they have an office in Ottawa

2012-12-21 02:55:58	chance	40% i think
2012-12-21 02:56:24	tangentstorm	chance, Z_Mass : intothev01d owns/set up the game-off repo
2012-12-21 02:56:34	tangentstorm	i just forked it so it would be on our list
2012-12-21 02:57:13	chance	also, mozilla's standard entry salary is roughly $80,000 a year for a dev, and you get a bonus every year, which is is a minimum of like roughly 10k
2012-12-21 02:57:40	tangentstorm	dang
2012-12-21 02:57:52	Z_Mass	I'd love to telecommute.. Would be awesome to be home with the kid(s)
2012-12-21 02:57:55	tangentstorm	who is funding mozilla?
2012-12-21 02:57:58	Z_Mass	wow
2012-12-21 02:58:27	chance	its funded by donations through the mozilla foundation
2012-12-21 02:58:52	Z_Mass	You probably need to have a cs education from university to work there though, right?
2012-12-21 02:58:54	chance	mostly google though
2012-12-21 02:59:04	chance	Z_Mass: eh depends.
2012-12-21 02:59:08	chance	its pretty important
2012-12-21 02:59:19	chance	but if you know what your doing its not a big deal
2012-12-21 02:59:31	chance	internships and the people you know are a huge part of it
2012-12-21 02:59:43	chance	my current job is a mozilla/rackspace shop
2012-12-21 03:00:09	chance	a large portion of the students who graduate from my school who worked at my job went to those orgs
2012-12-21 03:00:14	chance	lol
2012-12-21 03:00:18	Z_Mass	that's awesome

2012-12-21 03:01:41	chance	nice
2012-12-21 03:01:44	Z_Mass	My dad's boss who is my friends dad said he would probably be able to get me in at their company doing stuff with 911 phones though
2012-12-21 03:01:56	Z_Mass	That could be interesting.. I'd have to learn erlang though lol
2012-12-21 03:02:14	chance	Google and other popular engines provide default search referrals and which are said to account for over 80% of the company’s total revenue

2012-12-21 03:05:26	chance	yeah, and the best part is how relaxed it is
2012-12-21 03:05:37	Z_Mass	Does firefox still have the memory leak problem?
2012-12-21 03:05:39	chance	its one of those jobs where you know, you just get some cool stuff done and relax.
2012-12-21 03:05:42	chance	Z_Mass: no
2012-12-21 03:05:48	chance	not 'the'
2012-12-21 03:05:48	tangentstorm	yes
2012-12-21 03:05:50	tangentstorm	oh
2012-12-21 03:05:56	tangentstorm	many many many leaks
2012-12-21 03:06:06	tangentstorm	you can sit there and just watch it grow
2012-12-21 03:06:06	chance	most applications have leaks
2012-12-21 03:06:09	tangentstorm	yeah but not like firefox
2012-12-21 03:06:21	chance	firefox isn't that bad anymore
2012-12-21 03:06:35	tangentstorm	it is on my machine... granted, i use aurora
2012-12-21 03:06:55	chance	i use nightly, and its using roughly 400M
2012-12-21 03:06:57	tangentstorm	but i routinely have to restart it to reclaim memory or my system will bog down
2012-12-21 03:06:57	chance	b
2012-12-21 03:07:12	Z_Mass	Hmm, I'll have to try it out again.. I want to start using vimperator
2012-12-21 03:07:27	chance	also i have a lot of plugins
2012-12-21 03:08:03	tangentstorm	mine's using 254MB right now. that's low. chrome is using 132 or so..
2012-12-21 03:08:51	chance	also addons can have memory leaks too
2012-12-21 03:08:53	Z_Mass	is there a way to get the full ram usage for chrome?
2012-12-21 03:08:54	chance	so that could be part of it sometimes
2012-12-21 03:09:07	Z_Mass	it shows up as a seperate process for each tab
2012-12-21 03:09:12	tangentstorm	chance: yeah, i suspect firebug in particular
2012-12-21 03:09:24	chance	yeah..
2012-12-21 03:09:34	chance	firebug is a huge part of my memory footprint
2012-12-21 03:09:39	Z_Mass	Gmail claims it's using 181,740K
2012-12-21 03:10:23	chance	also, when you look at the memory in something like top/htop the total memory you see is memory reserved, not memory in use.
2012-12-21 03:10:44	tangentstorm	okay it's actually 253,908 ... i suspect if i go read a book for an hour it'll break 255 or so.
2012-12-21 03:11:16	Z_Mass	chrome://memory-redirect has more status actually
2012-12-21 03:11:36	tangentstorm	chance: yeah, that's the point of a memory leak :) it's reserving memory it doesn't need :/
2012-12-21 03:12:38	tangentstorm	just broke 254,000 ... i'm not touching the app and i'm just on the ZUI screen
2012-12-21 03:13:23	Z_Mass	How can this be.. It says I'm using 1.2G for chrome
2012-12-21 03:13:24	tangentstorm	oh snap. 257 now
2012-12-21 03:13:44	tangentstorm	all i did was alt tab and bring it to the foreground
2012-12-21 03:15:09	tangentstorm	interesting... it reclaimed 7mb and now it's creeping back up again
2012-12-21 03:15:24	tangentstorm	released i mean
2012-12-21 03:15:27	chance	mines stayed at 1.2 Gb roughly for a while, but thats quite a bit
2012-12-21 03:15:44	tangentstorm	do you use the zui screen?
2012-12-21 03:15:54	Z_Mass	I have 15 tabs open, but still
2012-12-21 03:16:14	chance	zui?
2012-12-21 03:16:26	tangentstorm	"tab groups"
2012-12-21 03:16:42	chance	i have tab groups available in nightly, but i dont use them
2012-12-21 03:17:24	tangentstorm	maybe that's why it leaks so much for me... i use them a lot, and it's a relatively newer feature
2012-12-21 03:17:36	chance	mines sitting at ~800 pretty well after restarting without addons
2012-12-21 03:17:48	chance	addons are probably the cause of the majority of the leaks
2012-12-21 03:18:07	chance	this is nightly
2012-12-21 03:18:31	tangentstorm	could very well be
2012-12-21 03:18:58	chance	nightly does indeed take quite a bit though
2012-12-21 03:19:03	tangentstorm	it really should be garbage collected if you're going to allow plugins like that.
2012-12-21 03:20:26	chance	idk, im biased, and i like firefox. chrome doesn't grow over time as bad, but it doesn't scale as well as you increase the number of tabs
2012-12-21 03:20:47	tangentstorm	i think it's a nicer browser except for the leaks, regardless of what's causing them.. restarting it occasionally is really no big deal
2012-12-21 03:21:16	chance	i never run into ram problems, my laptop has 8 Gb and ive never gotten close to that
2012-12-21 03:21:20	tangentstorm	chance: have you seen/used mozrepl?
2012-12-21 03:21:20	chance	lol
2012-12-21 03:22:02	tangentstorm	my laptop overheats sometimes and just shuts down.. probably time for a new one but i'll have to wait until i'm back in business for that
2012-12-21 03:22:34	Z_Mass	+1 for lenovo
2012-12-21 03:22:34	chance	i havent, but ive looked at it before
2012-12-21 03:28:23	chance	indeed
2012-12-21 03:28:23	chance	oh thats another thing, i need to write a karma plugin for lpmcbot and hamper
2012-12-21 03:28:23	chance	as well as the bitly shortener
2012-12-21 03:28:23	chance	the nice thing is making it work for one shouldn't be that hard to make work for the other
2012-12-21 03:30:34	Z_Mass	chance: What are you going to use for a db?
2012-12-21 03:31:12	chance	sqlite
2012-12-21 03:31:17	chance	and sqlalchemy
2012-12-21 03:31:17	chance	hamper already has those, id have to implement that for lpmcbot
2012-12-21 03:31:21	chance	which i was going to do anyways
2012-12-21 03:32:06	Z_Mass	Have you ever worked with redis? that's what jfredett suggested I use for the percy karma plugin
2012-12-21 03:32:53	Z_Mass	It holds everything in ram, and writes to a log file. it seems pointless to have it in ram I find though
2012-12-21 03:33:17	Z_Mass	at least for this use, it's not like we need crazy speed to get a users karma rating
2012-12-21 03:33:22	chance	file IO is bad
2012-12-21 03:33:57	Z_Mass	I thought sqlite stored it's data in a file?
2012-12-21 03:34:16	chance	redis is more about a data structure which has offline support
2012-12-21 03:34:45	chance	yes it is, but it its data is stored in binary
2012-12-21 03:34:50	chance	its a more advanced implementation
2012-12-21 03:35:38	Z_Mass	Wouldn't it be better suited for something like a karma plugin than redis?
2012-12-21 03:35:50	chance	redis is like an in memory solution, a database isn't
2012-12-21 03:35:50	chance	its a disk solution for redundancy
2012-12-21 03:35:57	chance	probably
2012-12-21 03:36:50	chance	it doesnt really matter unless redis has a large memory footprint
2012-12-21 03:36:50	chance	that might be worth it for the spead redis offers for some apps, but unnecessary and possibly bad for a smaller app
2012-12-21 03:36:59	Z_Mass	does sqlite require a server running?
2012-12-21 03:37:11	chance	no
2012-12-21 03:37:40	Z_Mass	hmm, I may talk to him about doing it in sqlite then
2012-12-21 03:37:40	chance	its just a file, rather than a socket that you connect to which provides concurency access
2012-12-21 03:37:58	Z_Mass	Would be good practice for my db class this semester
2012-12-21 03:38:31	chance	s/concurency/concurrent/
2012-12-21 03:38:31	hamper2	chance actually meant: its just a file, rather than a socket that you connect to which provides concurrent access
2012-12-21 03:38:39	chance	databases arent that bad, just a syntax to pick up, and understand its basic workigns
2012-12-21 03:38:41	chance	its pretty simple
2012-12-21 03:39:04	chance	its more about planning and how to properly normalize data (aka relations, why they're better than just attributes)
2012-12-21 03:40:04	Z_Mass	most of the syntax for sqlite should carry over to mysql, right?
2012-12-21 03:40:28	chance	mostly
2012-12-21 03:40:30	chance	its sql
2012-12-21 03:40:30	chance	its not a big deal
2012-12-21 03:40:30	chance	theres a small difference in the available functiosn
2012-12-21 03:40:32	chance	functions*

2012-12-21 15:25:12	Z_Mass	Hey jfredett, was just wondering if you thought sqlite would be better for the karma plugin?
2012-12-21 15:27:25	jfredett	Z_Mass: erm, I don't think sqlite is good for anything, really. :)
2012-12-21 15:27:43	jfredett	Redis is nice because it has the sorted sets for free, and it's pretty lightweight. Why were you thinking sqlite?
2012-12-21 15:28:00	jfredett	any particular feature you're missing or something?
2012-12-21 15:31:21	Z_Mass	Mainly because I have a db class using mysql next semester, lol
2012-12-21 15:31:28	Z_Mass	Just to get used to the syntax.

2012-12-21 16:19:16	jfredett	so I'd really love a plugin that tracks the github repos and calculates some metrics about who's committing to what, and how often -- as well as maybe some registration of users->projects, I'll write up some stories for it. I think that'd be a better use case for a SQL store than the karma plugin

2012-12-21 17:30:07	SirSkidmore	I've been thinking about it
2012-12-21 17:30:12	Enalicho	Linux and the entire ecosystem has become horribly bloated in recent years

2012-12-21 17:30:58	Enalicho	Haiku has been generating a buzz for a few years now, but really it's a toy OS
2012-12-21 17:31:06	Enalicho	still, perfect for old pcs
2012-12-21 17:31:08	SirSkidmore	yeah
2012-12-21 17:31:19	SirSkidmore	NetBSD might be a good choice too tangentstorm

2012-12-21 17:37:11	kumul	well... everyone would have moved to bsd instead, linux couldnt get bsd so he made his own kernel instead
2012-12-21 17:37:27	kumul	arrows?
2012-12-21 17:37:36	kumul	s/linux/linus/
2012-12-21 17:37:37	hamper2	kumul actually meant: well... everyone would have moved to bsd instead, linus couldnt get bsd so he made his own kernel instead
2012-12-21 17:38:35	Enalicho	I don't think it would - it would've died as just some novel thing a kid did, as opposed to changing things. There was a lot of Legal issues with BSD around the time of Linux's initial release
2012-12-21 17:38:51	tangentstorm	kumul : pioneers = the people with arrows in their backs
2012-12-21 17:40:52	kumul	Enalicho: i guess in a way it would be so...
2012-12-21 17:41:30	kumul	tangentstorm: i still dont get it (but dont mind explaining, i think very literally)
2012-12-21 17:42:00	kumul	i wonder, why did no one move to plan9 when it came out?
2012-12-21 17:45:12	SirSkidmore	someone ported plan9 to the Pi
2012-12-21 17:45:25	SirSkidmore	I kind of want to buy a pi or two and try it out
2012-12-21 17:46:49	tangentstorm	you can try it just on normal hardware :)
2012-12-21 17:47:48	SirSkidmore	I have before
2012-12-21 17:48:13	SirSkidmore	It would be awesome if we could get like a Plan9 club going at whatever uni I attend next year
2012-12-21 17:48:23	SirSkidmore	and just a supercomputer's worth of Raspberry Pis
2012-12-21 17:53:43	kumul	considering you can work remotely on it, it would be perfect, just a server somewhere hosting everything and some mobile device... thats how it should be run
2012-12-21 17:53:54	SirSkidmore	that's kinda what I do
2012-12-21 17:54:04	SirSkidmore	I don't keep very much stuff on my local machines, esp my netbook
2012-12-21 17:54:28	SirSkidmore	I just keep a tmux session on my server running all the time with WeeChat, Mutt, and Emacs, specifically for org-mode
2012-12-21 17:55:53	kumul	i wish i could do that, but i dont like TUI stuff
2012-12-21 17:55:57	kumul	the terminal is very limited
2012-12-21 17:56:59	SirSkidmore	I love text-mode stuff
2012-12-21 17:57:07	SirSkidmore	I find most GUIs cumbersome
2012-12-21 17:59:14	SirSkidmore	Like I discoverd mpd + ncmpcpp the other day, and I am just completely in love with both of those tools
2012-12-21 17:59:49	kumul	ok, an example, weechat, now weechat has a windows, panes in tmux world, can you copy from a pane? no, there are no actual border limits! so copy/pasting is bothersome
2012-12-21 17:59:50	SirSkidmore	Why use a heavy app like Banshee, when I can make a playlist with TUI, close the app, and have it play with relatively low resources in the bg
2012-12-21 17:59:58	SirSkidmore	true
2012-12-21 18:00:15	SirSkidmore	It's irritating to copy+paste stuff
2012-12-21 18:00:19	tangentstorm	kumul : you can copy and paste... why not?
2012-12-21 18:00:30	kumul	tangentstorm: you can? how?
2012-12-21 18:00:52	tangentstorm	well... i run everything inside tmux
2012-12-21 18:01:06	tangentstorm	so i just hit prefix-[
2012-12-21 18:01:09	SirSkidmore	tangentstorm: what term are you using?
2012-12-21 18:01:35	tangentstorm	16:55:32        kumul | i wish i could do that, but i dont like TUI stuff
2012-12-21 18:01:48	kumul	SirSkidmore: this is wily, a clone of acme, look at how much resources it consumes: 1  20    0 11380K  1340K select   0:00  0.00% wily
2012-12-21 18:01:51	tangentstorm	17:00:49  SirSkidmore | tangentstorm: what term are you using?
2012-12-21 18:02:04	tangentstorm	did both of those with the keyboard.
2012-12-21 18:02:16	SirSkidmore	tangentstorm: what term do you use?
2012-12-21 18:02:17	tangentstorm	SirSkidmore: putty
2012-12-21 18:02:19	SirSkidmore	oh
2012-12-21 18:02:21	SirSkidmore	heh
2012-12-21 18:02:35	SirSkidmore	I get mad at URxvt for making it difficult to copy paste
2012-12-21 18:02:40	tangentstorm	but tmux itself has mouse support
2012-12-21 18:02:45	SirSkidmore	I'm sure I'm jsut doing something simple wrond
2012-12-21 18:02:49	SirSkidmore	wrong**
2012-12-21 18:03:21	tangentstorm	i'm not sure how to do rectangular cut/paste in tmux though, but it's probably addable
2012-12-21 18:03:36	 *	tangentstorm has been thinking about porting tmux to pascal anyway for a while
2012-12-21 18:03:51	SirSkidmore	tmux is just soooo much better than screen
2012-12-21 18:04:15	kumul	tangentstorm: yes but im not talking about tmux, im talking about weechat, weechat creates its own windows/panes for each buffer/channel, and it is impossible to copy in this fashion...
2012-12-21 18:04:22	kumul	tmux does it, but it doesnt show on my term
2012-12-21 18:04:31	kumul	like a normal copy paste does
2012-12-21 18:04:38	kumul	s/paste//
2012-12-21 18:04:39	hamper2	kumul actually meant: like a normal copy  does
2012-12-21 18:04:43	tangentstorm	kumul: i'm running weechat right now inside of tmux
2012-12-21 18:05:22	kumul	tangentstorm: and can you snarf correctly in a divided window?
2012-12-21 18:05:38	tangentstorm	i don't know what snarfing is or how to divide windows
2012-12-21 18:05:45	kumul	 /window splitv
2012-12-21 18:05:58	tangentstorm	well that looks terrible :)
2012-12-21 18:06:06	kumul	... XD
2012-12-21 18:06:20	kumul	install buffers.pl and see
2012-12-21 18:06:33	SirSkidmore	I use buffers.pl
2012-12-21 18:06:43	SirSkidmore	Is that why I can't paste things into weechat?
2012-12-21 18:06:45	kumul	so weechat uses mouse actions for gestures, thats a bad idea in a TUI
2012-12-21 18:06:47	tangentstorm	123456789|123456789|123456789|123456789|
2012-12-21 18:06:56	kumul	SirSkidmore: you can paste things
2012-12-21 18:07:08	tangentstorm	i only get 46 words of space in the middle column if i split the screen
2012-12-21 18:07:15	tangentstorm	46 characters i mean
2012-12-21 18:07:16	kumul	SirSkidmore: ctrl+shift+insert
2012-12-21 18:07:34	kumul	tangentstorm: just keep splitting!
2012-12-21 18:08:07	tangentstorm	now i can barely see anything?
2012-12-21 18:08:13	kumul	tangentstorm: its handy in channels where no one throws very long lines (like this one)
2012-12-21 18:08:15	SirSkidmore	⎈
2012-12-21 18:08:18	SirSkidmore	nope
2012-12-21 18:08:24	SirSkidmore	It's either URxvt or Weechat
2012-12-21 18:08:32	SirSkidmore	and I think it's a combination of the two
2012-12-21 18:08:40	tangentstorm	how do i unsplit this thing?
2012-12-21 18:08:51	kumul	tangentstorm: theres /window (split(v h) merge)
2012-12-21 18:08:52	tangentstorm	i just run weechat full screen
2012-12-21 18:08:54	kumul	tangentstorm: merge
2012-12-21 18:09:10	tangentstorm	ahhh much better :)
2012-12-21 18:09:28	kumul	SirSkidmore: i can in xterm, shift+insert should paste whats on xclipboard
2012-12-21 18:09:42	tangentstorm	i run weechat full screen and just swap between the channels when someone's talking
2012-12-21 18:09:46	SirSkidmore	http://hackaday.com/2012/12/21/raspberry-pi-laptop-is-just-a-little-too-big-for-a-pocket/
2012-12-21 18:09:51	SirSkidmore	kumul: aw hell yeah
2012-12-21 18:10:00	SirSkidmore	that's an interesting link btw
2012-12-21 18:10:02	SirSkidmore	thanks for that
2012-12-21 18:10:21	SirSkidmore	I could not figure it out! Middle click worked in every other tmux window, but not this one
2012-12-21 18:10:52	tangentstorm	hrm... i think i will install netbsd with xen and run haiku and oberon under that
2012-12-21 18:10:57	kumul	thats weird, laptops go on your lap, they are too big for pockets... unless you wore khakis or something
2012-12-21 18:11:58	kumul	SirSkidmore: thats because weechat intercepts mouse events, why didnt you ask in channel? their very helpful people :)
2012-12-21 18:12:12	SirSkidmore	because I just noticed it today
2012-12-21 18:12:14	SirSkidmore	haha
2012-12-21 18:12:47	kumul	im thinking (well its mandatory  now) to make a script in it, i've yet to choose a scripting language to learn for it. Soooo lua or tcl?
2012-12-21 18:12:55	kumul	actually ill just ask in channel
2012-12-21 18:13:05	kumul	:)
2012-12-21 18:13:31	SirSkidmore	I would say Lua
2012-12-21 18:13:42	SirSkidmore	I've heard some good things about the language
2012-12-21 18:14:07	kumul	tangentstorm: they were going to teach a friend pascal in the college he's attending, he ended up switching just for that, why do i hear such bad things about pascal?
2012-12-21 18:14:15	kumul	although i dont like typing that much
2012-12-21 18:14:46	kumul	SirSkidmore: i hear bad things about the way weechat does scripting, something about callbacks (no clue what that is)
2012-12-21 18:14:56	kumul	which lua handles badly or something
2012-12-21 18:15:10	SirSkidmore	Just do python or Ruby
2012-12-21 18:15:18	SirSkidmore	I think weechat can handle Ruby, right?
2012-12-21 18:15:41	kumul	this is what you get for butting in on conversations, pure confusion
2012-12-21 18:15:54	kumul	SirSkidmore: yes, but im no fan of heavy languages
2012-12-21 18:16:09	SirSkidmore	aw
2012-12-21 18:16:17	SirSkidmore	I love Ruby
2012-12-21 18:16:25	SirSkidmore	its syntax is simply beautiful
2012-12-21 18:17:08	kumul	plus there's a bit of hate on ruby... less so than python
2012-12-21 18:17:23	SirSkidmore	I know
2012-12-21 18:17:30	SirSkidmore	and I find it somewhat confusing
2012-12-21 18:17:47	SirSkidmore	but probably because I don't know enough about programming to undersand why
2012-12-21 18:18:04	tangentstorm	kumul: no idea. pascal is awesome. maybe it just doesn't have a lot of people advocating for it.
2012-12-21 18:19:08	kumul	perhaps tangentstorm should just make forth be used for scripting weechat? ;)
2012-12-21 18:19:27	tangentstorm	haha why me?
2012-12-21 18:19:31	kumul	supposedly ficl is good for that
2012-12-21 18:19:37	 *	tangentstorm wouldn't know what to do with a weechat script
2012-12-21 18:20:10	tangentstorm	what's an example of something you'd want to script in weechat?
2012-12-21 18:20:12	kumul	well, you're the only person who actually uses forth that i know of who isnt nuts
2012-12-21 18:20:39	kumul	well im planning on making it beep/notify me on privmsg or someone saying my nick
2012-12-21 18:21:33	kumul	i also need a script that doesnt open a window on privmsg when you filter everything on that window (leaving the window empty)
2012-12-21 18:21:48	kumul	and so on (too much ideas man)
2012-12-21 18:22:06	tangentstorm	i am too nuts!!
2012-12-21 18:22:23	kumul	well... even better!
2012-12-21 18:22:25	SirSkidmore	well, I'm gonna go grab a bite to eat
2012-12-21 18:22:26	SirSkidmore	be back
2012-12-21 18:22:32	--	SirSkidmore is now known as SirSkids|Away
2012-12-21 18:22:33	kumul	eat to bite
2012-12-21 18:23:42	tangentstorm	kumul : doesn't it already beep like that? ... i guess i turn sound off
2012-12-21 18:23:46	kumul	maybe thats a bad idea, but wouldnt you say it would be nice that forth was everywhere? more well known
2012-12-21 18:24:14	tangentstorm	not turn sound off... i just leave a pair of earbuds plugged into the speaker port :)
2012-12-21 18:24:17	kumul	tangentstorm: it beeps, but i dont have a notifier for a status bar abstraction i just made
2012-12-21 18:24:45	tangentstorm	status bar inside weechat?
2012-12-21 18:24:46	kumul	well, i just made it, of course nothing exists for it
2012-12-21 18:25:06	kumul	no, for the WM im using
2012-12-21 18:25:31	tangentstorm	hmm
2012-12-21 18:26:33	kumul	dont even get me started on changing bars on weechat! i want to take out all of these input bars and leave one on the bottom, saving about 3 lines for more content (which probably means ill split more windows :)
2012-12-21 18:26:40	kumul	see? lots to do :)
2012-12-21 18:26:54	kumul	of examples
2012-12-21 18:27:03	tangentstorm	ok
2012-12-21 18:27:30	tangentstorm	none of that is really weechat specific though
2012-12-21 18:27:46	tangentstorm	hmm
2012-12-21 18:28:08	kumul	mm? it is?
2012-12-21 18:28:14	tangentstorm	well i guess it is but only because weechat is doing its own window management stuff.
2012-12-21 18:28:52	kumul	yeah... would be nice if tmux could handle all of that
2012-12-21 18:29:06	tangentstorm	i wish i could just have text buffers, and could place chat windows and emacs windows and shell windows all side by side
2012-12-21 18:29:18	kumul	without having a bunch of extra processes around (kind of the way xchat does it)
2012-12-21 18:30:19	tangentstorm	i guess if i were going to script weechat or irc or something i'd break the app down into smaller pieces and compose it
2012-12-21 18:31:20	tangentstorm	there's an irc client written in perl i think that simply exposes the lines as different unix fifo things
2012-12-21 18:31:37	tangentstorm	whatever you call what you get with mkfifo
2012-12-21 18:31:45	tangentstorm	named pipes
2012-12-21 18:32:10	tangentstorm	hmm.. i'm rambling :)
2012-12-21 18:32:41	tangentstorm	anyway, i'm not really all that great with forth yet. :/
2012-12-21 18:38:54	kumul	neither am i, because hey if it was viable/possible to use forth instead of another language i would (maybe? never know, because it isnt possible yet!)
2012-12-21 18:39:05	kumul	i cant do serious things in it
2012-12-21 18:39:20	kumul	also, the client your talking about is called ii and its written in c
2012-12-21 18:41:31	kumul	(i know, because i made this https://bitbucket.org/nal/ircfs/src/0cef7cf80dad4f5c31558ba778dfcb993b65c814/ii-plugins.brc?at=default for it
2012-12-21 18:41:47	kumul	https://bitbucket.org/nal/ircfs crap not that

2012-12-21 19:02:41	kumul	tangentstorm: but, you just have to wait a couple of hours!
2012-12-21 19:02:52	tangentstorm	what happens in a few hours?

2012-12-21 19:04:06	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-21 19:04:23	tangentstorm	my options in netbsd for a default shell are sh, ksh, and csh
2012-12-21 19:04:32	kumul	csh
2012-12-21 19:04:57	kumul	csh = completions
2012-12-21 19:05:02	kumul	sh = NOTHING
2012-12-21 19:05:29	kumul	ksh is nice but no completions either i think
2012-12-21 19:08:51	tangentstorm	looks like they added it...
2012-12-21 19:09:05	tangentstorm	but csh isn't as c-like as i feared
2012-12-21 19:09:15	tangentstorm	not that i write all that many shell scripts anyway
2012-12-21 19:09:24	kumul	tangentstorm: rc is the only c-like shell there is
2012-12-21 19:09:41	kumul	that link i gave was made in it
2012-12-21 19:10:12	tangentstorm	the plan 9 shell.. huh
2012-12-21 19:14:05	tangentstorm	csh it is
2012-12-21 19:14:34	kumul	its what i use, kind of proud. i've reached a point where i dont need to test for everything i write... actually i made something yesterday where i didnt test anything till i finished... not a lot of lines but >50 is a record for me.
2012-12-21 19:14:58	kumul	and it worked!
2012-12-21 19:15:18	tangentstorm	:)
2012-12-21 19:15:44	tangentstorm	ok. time to unplug. hopefully will be back shortly :)

2012-12-24 00:53:20	Z_Mass	Anyone got experience writing a rest client?
2012-12-24 00:56:05	chance	somewhat
2012-12-24 00:56:15	chance	ive made a REST web app
2012-12-24 00:57:50	Z_Mass	I'm thinking about making an ncurses music browser/player for subsonic. 
2012-12-24 00:58:38	Z_Mass	Would it be worth storing the folder structure in a db at startup? Or is it quick enough I could just ask for it everytime I need it
2012-12-24 00:58:53	chance	i wouldnt use subsonic, it isn't done that well, imo
2012-12-24 00:59:11	Z_Mass	What don't you like about it?
2012-12-24 00:59:23	chance	its not very good, breaks, javabased
2012-12-24 00:59:29	chance	web client isnt very good
2012-12-24 00:59:37	Z_Mass	I've been using the web interface for quite a while now, never had problems
2012-12-24 00:59:42	chance	mpd is pretty good though.
2012-12-24 01:00:45	Z_Mass	Hmm, how would I go about using mpd, the mp3's are on a local windows pc
2012-12-24 01:01:16	chance	you wouldnt have write access to NTFS, but you should be able to share them via the network
2012-12-24 01:01:17	chance	or
2012-12-24 01:01:24	chance	use a VM
2012-12-24 01:01:57	Z_Mass	I don't need write, I just want to be able to browse/play them from the command line
2012-12-24 01:02:27	Z_Mass	I was thinking subsonic because it's already working local and remote, plus it's already organized
2012-12-24 01:02:58	Z_Mass	+ I have lifetime dns since I donated
2012-12-24 01:04:06	chance	you could, but i mean i dont like subsonic
2012-12-24 01:04:38	chance	i imagine windows being pretty shitty at anything in that area, imo, but thats me. Linux just has too many nice things already done for these things
2012-12-24 01:04:43	chance	you wouldnt have to write anything if you used mpd
2012-12-24 01:05:42	Z_Mass	I have linux on that box, but it's hooked up to my living room tv, so my gf uses it (she doesn't mind linux, she mainly watches tv or goes on fb) but it's my game console as well lol
2012-12-24 01:06:26	Z_Mass	So with mpd, I could play them on any local computer?
2012-12-24 01:08:52	chance	yeah, mpd is a server
2012-12-24 01:08:58	chance	music player daemon :)
2012-12-24 01:09:18	chance	the nice thing about linux, is you could run mpd on it in the living room, and mpd is just in the background
2012-12-24 01:09:23	chance	just dont turn off the computer.
2012-12-24 01:10:25	Z_Mass	Does it use the id3 tags or the folder layout for organization?

2012-12-24 01:11:07	 *	Z_Mass likes streaming music from school.
2012-12-24 01:11:15	chance	it doesnt do anything except serve music
2012-12-24 01:11:35	chance	http://www.webupd8.org/2011/02/stream-music-to-your-android-device.html
2012-12-24 01:11:35	hamper2	chance's shortened url is http://bit.ly/VeW3pq
2012-12-24 01:12:21	chance	so, bind to localhost
2012-12-24 01:12:34	chance	and then, set your clients to point to the IP address or DNS
2012-12-24 01:14:28	Z_Mass	Hmm, I'm going to look into that then, no sense reinventing a music browser 
2012-12-24 01:15:05	chance	lol
2012-12-24 01:15:13	chance	mpd has like a bazillion clients too
2012-12-24 01:15:27	chance	web, curses, cli, gtk, qt, and multiples for each

2012-12-24 01:17:10	Z_Mass	Well I just figured out I can set nvlc to stream subsonic by opening a .m3u and then just set the files in the web client
2012-12-24 01:17:20	Z_Mass	But that will be my next project, to set that up
2012-12-24 01:17:38	chance	lol
2012-12-24 01:17:54	chance	i think in the next week im going to switch from apache to cyclone
2012-12-24 01:18:20	Z_Mass	never heard of cyclone
2012-12-24 01:19:21	Z_Mass	a safe version of c?
2012-12-24 01:20:03	Z_Mass	heh, I'm guessing you meant what is at cyclone.io?
2012-12-24 01:20:08	chance	yeah
2012-12-24 01:20:45	chance	cyclone is a fork of tornado, using twisteds event loop for the connections, rather than tornado's own http handler
2012-12-24 01:22:25	chance	https://github.com/fiorix/cyclone

2012-12-24 01:23:09	Z_Mass	Ya was looking at that. Most of it means nothing to me though :P
2012-12-24 01:23:49	Z_Mass	Which mpd cli client would you recommend?
2012-12-24 01:25:04	chance	idk
2012-12-24 01:25:09	chance	i dont use it
2012-12-24 01:25:11	chance	xD
2012-12-24 01:25:20	chance	i use pianobar for pandora and spotify
2012-12-24 01:26:51	Z_Mass	lol I'll have to ask SirSkidmore how he likes that client he started using. 
2012-12-24 01:28:26	Z_Mass	Have you used steromood?
2012-12-24 01:28:46	chance	no
2012-12-24 01:29:19	Z_Mass	Hunh.. both pandora and spotify are not available in Canada -_-
2012-12-24 01:29:48	Z_Mass	I found some cool stuff on steromood, you just enter a mood and it gives you these giant playlists

2012-12-24 15:06:14	Z_Mass	It's been a little while since I've done any C++.. If I have class B as a private variable of class A, how to I explicitly call B's constructor?
2012-12-24 15:06:27	Z_Mass	*do
2012-12-24 15:30:47	chance	depends
2012-12-24 15:30:53	chance	is it a pointer, or no?
2012-12-24 15:31:14	Z_Mass	Nope
2012-12-24 15:31:27	chance	any args being passed to it?
2012-12-24 15:31:45	Z_Mass	Not anymore, but it would still be good to know
2012-12-24 15:32:15	Z_Mass	From what I could tell from the error, it would need to be done in class A's constructor, correct?
2012-12-24 15:32:25	chance	so basically there are multiple constructors in C++, and you can call different ones
2012-12-24 15:32:50	chance	Z_Mass: yeah, so when you declare the class, either you declare it using the default, or pass it the values in the class definition
2012-12-24 15:32:57	chance	or
2012-12-24 15:33:21	chance	you can do it in the constructor with a pointer to the object, and you call it using new
2012-12-24 15:33:57	chance	actually, if its a pointer you can call its constructor wherever, in a setter if you wish even
2012-12-24 15:34:43	Z_Mass	Hmm, interesting. Would there be any performance gains from having class B be a pointer in class A?
2012-12-24 15:36:51	Z_Mass	Currently it's declared as A class_a;
2012-12-24 15:36:57	chance	not really, heap memory isnt as fast as the memory on stack
2012-12-24 15:37:07	chance	Z_Mass: at that point its using the default constructor
2012-12-24 15:38:28	chance	you could declare it as A class_a(1, 2, 3) if you needed to pass its values, and that would go in the class definition
2012-12-24 15:38:53	Z_Mass	Even if it's declared in A.h?
2012-12-24 15:39:10	chance	or, call the default constructor, and in your normal constructor, use the setters for that class to adjust the defaults
2012-12-24 15:39:15	chance	Z_Mass: what?
2012-12-24 15:39:33	Z_Mass	Class B is a private variable of class A
2012-12-24 15:39:49	Z_Mass	I didn't know you could pass directly to the constructor like that
2012-12-24 15:40:57	chance	oh, no, so like
2012-12-24 15:40:59	chance	let me write an example

2012-12-30 14:16:44	Z_Mass	I've got a few questions regarding C++ templates if anyone if familiar with them
2012-12-30 14:17:32	jfredett	hmm, I don't see xxyyzzxxzzxzzxzsxcalsdkjasdIA IA CTHULU FTAGHN (or however you spell jgulotta's name)
2012-12-30 14:17:44	jfredett	but I know he's been doing a lot of C++, I sadly know very little about C++
2012-12-30 14:18:09	Z_Mass	Heh, ya I never seem to catch him online lol
2012-12-30 14:20:23	tangentstorm	maybe ask in #learnprogramming ... Amadiro or someone probably knows
2012-12-30 14:20:54	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: jfredett and SirSkidmore decided to use go for the mail app they're writing
2012-12-30 14:21:15	tangentstorm	jfredett / SirSkidmore : Z_Mass has go experience :)
2012-12-30 14:21:31	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: K, I'll try that if Google doesn't come up with something.
2012-12-30 14:21:50	jfredett	hot dog.
2012-12-30 14:22:13	jfredett	Z_Mass -- SirSkidmore and I will probably be bugging you with questions about Go
2012-12-30 14:22:30	Z_Mass	As long as it's not about channels :D
2012-12-30 14:22:52	jfredett	now it will definitely be about channels. :)
2012-12-30 14:23:17	 *	Z_Mass googles go channels.
2012-12-30 14:23:21	Z_Mass	:P
2012-12-30 14:23:42	Z_Mass	When are you guys starting it? I noticed the repo in my feed this morning.
2012-12-30 14:24:42	jfredett	soon ish
2012-12-30 14:24:49	jfredett	we're in the research all the things phase
2012-12-30 14:26:03	Z_Mass	Cool, I'd be interested in working on that, if you need more people :)
2012-12-30 14:26:44	Z_Mass	I could never think of something worth doing in Go
2012-12-30 14:26:47	jfredett	sure sure
2012-12-30 14:27:06	jfredett	right now we're just poking around tryign to figure out all the various libraries we'll need
2012-12-30 14:27:54	jfredett	tangentstorm wants to use our email backend w/ his pascal stuff, I guess, so there will be some neat integration to do
2012-12-30 14:28:43	tangentstorm	so what exactly is this thing? something like mutt/pine?
2012-12-30 14:28:49	Z_Mass	Sounds like fun. 
2012-12-30 14:30:10	jfredett	tangentstorm yah, but better
2012-12-30 14:30:38	jfredett	ideally the configuration will be easier, it'll be able to interface with more storage formats than Mbox and MailDir
2012-12-30 14:30:45	jfredett	and it will support some better search features
2012-12-30 14:31:14	tangentstorm	imap/pop3?
2012-12-30 14:31:15	jfredett	I'd tell you all the neat thigns it does, but it doesn't do any of them yet
2012-12-30 14:31:35	jfredett	No, it'll rely on getmail, though we might have some tooling to generate the rc's for you
2012-12-30 14:32:13	jfredett	so it fits in exactly the same place as mutt, but will be better in terms of configuration, etc.
2012-12-30 14:32:27	jfredett	I have to bugger off, wife needs me, back in a while
2012-12-30 14:32:35	tangentstorm	interesting. seeya

2012-12-31 15:15:12	Z_Mass	I've got a quick design question. I'm looking at http://www.sdltutorials.com/sdl-events and they make a class with a giant switch case that calls virtual methods for each event. Then the base/engine class inherits the event class and overides the specific event methods it needs
2012-12-31 15:15:34	Z_Mass	Is there a nicer way of doing that, without inheriting the event class?
2012-12-31 15:23:19	tangentstorm	sure
2012-12-31 15:23:29	tangentstorm	lots of ways you could do it
2012-12-31 15:24:25	tangentstorm	lemme think
2012-12-31 15:25:05	Z_Mass	Cool, thanks. :)
2012-12-31 15:25:32	tangentstorm	well... really they all kind of work the same way, but you can make the code nicer
2012-12-31 15:26:11	tangentstorm	the various retro/ngaro implementations have sort of a similar issue with the bytecodes
2012-12-31 15:26:49	Z_Mass	I was thinking just have the event be a class member, and some way of registering a method from the base class to the event class. But I have no clue how I would do that :P
2012-12-31 15:27:22	tangentstorm	most of the implementations in retro seem to use a giant case statement like this
2012-12-31 15:28:01	tangentstorm	case/switch is actually pretty fast, but you can also  get a fast switch another way: by having an array of function pointers
2012-12-31 15:28:09	@intothev01d	holy fuck subclassing is so awesome :D
2012-12-31 15:28:31	Z_Mass	Ya, I have a feeling theres no getting away from the switch. I just find it kind of ugly to have to inherit the event class
2012-12-31 15:28:48	@intothev01d	im begining to get oop a bit, and trying to write everything just once (only override when I need to)

2012-12-31 15:29:43	tangentstorm	instead of using a switch statement, i populate an array like that this has the advantage of letting you re-arrange the handlers, and point many handlers at the same thing (like a default "do-nothing" handler)
2012-12-31 15:29:51	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Ya I'm trying to write better oop code too. Trying to move away from a game object class that can handle events and draw itself lol
2012-12-31 15:30:19	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: Interesting, I'll have a look at that. Thanks
2012-12-31 15:30:26	tangentstorm	it has the disadvantage that it's a bit harder to have different signatures for the methods
2012-12-31 15:30:33	@intothev01d	yea it's pretty neat. im writing a little number generator app for iOS right now, and basically i can inherit most of what I've written for other stuff
2012-12-31 15:31:00	@intothev01d	plus i sepearate out the logic from the views so it can be reused between views and such.
2012-12-31 15:31:15	@intothev01d	this is obviously the way its supposed to be done, but im just now kind of being able to logic it all out and make it work
2012-12-31 15:31:52	Z_Mass	Ya, theres much more planning involved, but in the end it's much easier to work with 
2012-12-31 15:32:10	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: no matter what you do, you're going to have some kind of dispatch mechanism. But usually you only have to write it once, and then that's your "framework" and it takes care of getting the events to the right place
2012-12-31 15:33:19	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: So do you think that inheriting the event class is a good way of doing it? (i'm trying to get that link to open but weechat is being a pain..)
2012-12-31 15:33:29	tangentstorm	if you use events, you pretty much are going to have to deal with a dispatch table, whether you code it as a case statement, or an array of pointers or whatever
2012-12-31 15:33:42	tangentstorm	hey where's our bot? :D
2012-12-31 15:33:59	tangentstorm	it's supposed to make friendly urls
2012-12-31 15:34:10	Z_Mass	 I can't even click it though -_-
2012-12-31 15:34:31	Z_Mass	urxvt is not very mouse friendly
2012-12-31 15:34:59	Z_Mass	nvm, got it to work with highlight/middle click :)
2012-12-31 15:35:09	tangentstorm	well just type github.com/sabren/b4 in your browser... that's what i do :)
2012-12-31 15:36:41	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: a lot of gui frameworks have you override a base event handler object, yes.
2012-12-31 15:37:15	Z_Mass	Hmm, in that case maybe I'll use that then. Won't be much typing involved :D
2012-12-31 15:37:39	tangentstorm	in squeak, there's a top level one called Morph. In wxwindows, it's wxWindow, although i think there are non-visual event handlers above that
2012-12-31 15:38:49	tangentstorm	in your browser, each html tag that is visualized on the screen has a visual object associated with it that has event handlers for onclick, onmouseover, etc.
2012-12-31 15:39:56	tangentstorm	in swing, i think you can make custom components that just listen for particular events because they implement interfaces like MouseListener
2012-12-31 15:40:39	tangentstorm	But you still have to have a framework behind the scenes that lets you register the object and dispatch events to it. The only real advantage is that you don't have to subclass.
2012-12-31 15:42:12	tangentstorm	intothev01d: :) inheritance rocks. subclassing as a way to inherit things is pretty cool too but it also can cause problems when you need to subclass multiple things (and it causes problems whether or not your language supports multiple inheritance!)...
2012-12-31 15:42:40	@intothev01d	true, if you have a lot of overriding it's mostly a moot point
2012-12-31 15:43:59	@intothev01d	objective-c doesn't have multiple inheritance but it has delegates, protocols, and some other things to deal with what you need for the most part
2012-12-31 15:43:59	tangentstorm	python has multiple inheritance, but you usually don't want to use multiple inheritance hierarchies...
2012-12-31 15:44:49	@intothev01d	in my case, i have a 2 views that do mostly the same stuff, just one has a tiny bit of difference, hense i can just subclass the first and get all the stuff i need with minimal overriding and additional stuff
2012-12-31 15:45:00	@intothev01d	hence* and yea i hope it works but it seems to so far
2012-12-31 15:45:23	tangentstorm	yeah... with delegates and protocols/interfaces, you can sort of just put lots of little objects together to make bigger ones... (python/ruby have a similar idea called mixins) the general term is "composition"...
2012-12-31 15:46:35	tangentstorm	sure. and if that gets to be a mess, you can extract a superclass to be the parent for both of them
2012-12-31 15:46:59	@intothev01d	yep
2012-12-31 15:47:09	tangentstorm	dunno if xcode offers refactoring support or not, but i'm sure the jetbrains thing for objc has all kinds of refactoring tools
2012-12-31 15:47:16	@intothev01d	plus i'm pulling all logic out. a lot of tutorials and beginner ios stuff just crams everything into the view controller (really not mvc at all)
2012-12-31 15:47:49	@intothev01d	like i have a generator class for creating the random numbers and number lists, then i have a validator class to handle my error checking
2012-12-31 15:47:53	tangentstorm	yeah. because it's easier to explain if everything's in one place
2012-12-31 15:48:19	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: btw, there are at least two ways to not have events at all. :)
2012-12-31 15:48:29	@intothev01d	the standford tutorials are the best though, they go through all of that. and yea it is easier to explain starting out
2012-12-31 15:48:38	@intothev01d	for simple stuff it doesn't really matter
2012-12-31 15:50:39	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: 1) super low level: only one object does anything at a time, and it manually checks the position of the mouse, checks whether a key is pressed, etc. this is how i did things in the old days before i understood how events work. it's VERY simple, but you wind up looping through all your controls anyway and it eventually winds up being a roll-your-own-event system :)
2012-12-31 15:54:19	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: 2) super high level: functional reactive programming. this is what that Elm language does. There are no event handlers. Instead, the world is modelled as a bunch of time-varying signals. So instead of a boolean function that says whether the mouse is over an area, you have three signals: the mouse position, the area's coordinates, and a third derived signal that yields the boolean. it's pretty
2012-12-31 15:54:20	tangentstorm	 awesome stuff, but still very experimental / bleeding edge ivory tower stuff... (elm is sort of an attempt to get it out of the ivory tower and into the hands of everyday developers)

2012-12-31 16:19:34	@intothev01d	geez, some of these chat rooms. any question means you're a noob and should start reading beginner stuff
2012-12-31 16:20:01	@intothev01d	like, it's a simple question, read it and then answer. i guess by just pointing to some docs you probably dont know either

2012-12-31 16:29:01	@intothev01d	im making a number generator app. want to put it on the app store
2012-12-31 16:29:18	@intothev01d	something simple just to get out there and have to point to and say, look i did that whoo hoo, hire me please :D
2012-12-31 16:29:32	@intothev01d	maybe people can use one too. they have a few already
2012-12-31 16:29:41	tangentstorm	i'm kind of thinking about using ︻ / ︼ as delimiters in a programming language. A lot of tools will just break right off the bat...
2012-12-31 16:29:54	@intothev01d	what in the world is that?
2012-12-31 16:29:59	tangentstorm	what sort of numbers would you generate?
2012-12-31 16:30:01	@intothev01d	random ones
2012-12-31 16:30:11	@intothev01d	like right now, i just take a range and generate a single number
2012-12-31 16:30:21	@intothev01d	next i'm going to allow distinct in range
2012-12-31 16:30:31	@intothev01d	then im going to allow them to create a list of random numbers
2012-12-31 16:30:41	tangentstorm	dress it up a bit! make it a dice app for DND gamers
2012-12-31 16:30:42	@intothev01d	then a list of distinct random numbers
2012-12-31 16:31:20	@intothev01d	yea i need then some dice graphics i would guess
2012-12-31 16:31:21	@intothev01d	ooo, a 3d rotating one would be cool
2012-12-31 16:31:41	tangentstorm	and then add accelleration so you can "shake" the dice up :)
2012-12-31 16:31:42	@intothev01d	maybe i'll do that next, as a separate app
2012-12-31 16:31:48	@intothev01d	yea thats what i was thinking
2012-12-31 16:32:23	tangentstorm	i bet the less general version that's polished for a particular audience actually sees more use :)
2012-12-31 16:32:41	tangentstorm	market segmentation ftw!
2012-12-31 16:32:55	@intothev01d	lol
2012-12-31 16:33:11	@intothev01d	you mean the one that has less features, like only random numbers and no dice?
2012-12-31 16:34:13	tangentstorm	no, i mean that a general-purpose random number generator that can generate any numbers will not sell as well as one that can only generate 20 numbers (or however many sides you have on your dice)
2012-12-31 16:34:31	@intothev01d	oh true
2012-12-31 16:34:32	@intothev01d	prob not
2012-12-31 16:35:02	@intothev01d	but you can select a range, so i dunno how this wouldnt be better?
2012-12-31 16:35:03	@intothev01d	lol
2012-12-31 16:35:13	@intothev01d	like you can do 1-20 over and over
2012-12-31 16:35:31	@intothev01d	you don't even have to type the range in each time, you can just leave it and hit generate over and over
2012-12-31 16:35:41	@intothev01d	i mean, cmon!
2012-12-31 16:35:42	@intothev01d	lol
2012-12-31 16:36:32	tangentstorm	yeah, the general purpose thing is obviously better but the more targeted one will almost certainly win out
2012-12-31 16:36:42	@intothev01d	sigh
2012-12-31 16:36:52	@intothev01d	lets hope not
2012-12-31 16:36:52	@intothev01d	:D
2012-12-31 16:37:28	@intothev01d	i'm about 1/4 there in 2 days time, so hope i can have this thing fully functional in a week or so
2012-12-31 16:37:42	@intothev01d	then it's off to to the App Store
2012-12-31 16:37:52	@intothev01d	but i have to pay 100 just to get it there :(
2012-12-31 16:38:50	@intothev01d	i made this thing as universal as possible (was going to target iOS 5 too but i'm going iOS 6 with iphone 5 support and iPad as well) i need some nice button and background graphics though
2012-12-31 16:39:12	@intothev01d	so may take a bit longer to get it all fully polished. hopefully before I go back to school

2013-01-03 02:18:00	tangentstorm	hypertext is non-linear text. linking is part of it (hence the HT in HTML) but it's really a lot more than that
2013-01-03 02:18:28	kumul	>
2013-01-03 02:18:31	kumul	 >
2013-01-03 02:18:32	tangentstorm	like the actual same text can appear in different places, but not copies of each other.
2013-01-03 02:18:33	kumul	>
2013-01-03 02:18:38	kumul	is that hyper text? its nonlinear
2013-01-03 02:18:42	kumul	:P
2013-01-03 02:18:53	tangentstorm	so if you edit one copy, all the other copies change simultaneously
2013-01-03 02:19:09	tangentstorm	that's why it has to go in a database
2013-01-03 02:19:29	tangentstorm	it's still linear in that it's one character after another
2013-01-03 02:19:46	kumul	i have this nice bookmarks db format, too bad it will never be usable
2013-01-03 02:20:25	kumul	what would it be useful for?
2013-01-03 02:21:22	tangentstorm	your bookmark format?
2013-01-03 02:21:57	kumul	you were talking about bmarks, im rambling pay no attention
2013-01-03 02:22:35	tangentstorm	the linking saves a ton of space, because you don't have to explain every last  thing inline
2013-01-03 02:23:08	tangentstorm	like on wikipedia, you can go to any page about math that you don't understand, and there'll be a link to a bunch of other terms you don't understand :D
2013-01-03 02:23:28	tangentstorm	so you can go not understand those, and click on those links, etc... :)
2013-01-03 02:23:41	tangentstorm	which is a mess...
2013-01-03 02:23:46	tangentstorm	code is like that
2013-01-03 02:23:48	kumul	cant yi dont understand anything
2013-01-03 02:24:04	tangentstorm	i call it the gestalt problem
2013-01-03 02:24:56	tangentstorm	but what if you could simultaneously have code that is explained step by step in a narrative ("how it got to be this way") and also laid out visually with diagrams (how it is now)?
2013-01-03 02:25:06	kumul	i just call it the "loop vease" which translates to "the look into loop"
2013-01-03 02:25:10	tangentstorm	in fact, what if you could watch the diagrams evolve from the first sketch
2013-01-03 02:25:29	kumul	isnt that like a popup?
2013-01-03 02:25:32	tangentstorm	it's spaghetti code :)
2013-01-03 02:25:43	kumul	popups or?
2013-01-03 02:25:46	tangentstorm	i mean wikipedia is spaghetti code
2013-01-03 02:25:53	tangentstorm	i'm picturing it more like a slide show or animation
2013-01-03 02:25:58	kumul	oh, but thats no fault of wikipedia
2013-01-03 02:26:09	tangentstorm	no it's inherent in graphs
2013-01-03 02:26:32	kumul	so a pdf with links
2013-01-03 02:27:07	tangentstorm	any time you try to search a graph but you don't have enough internal ram to track where you've already been and where you haven't, you'll wind up in an infinite loop
2013-01-03 02:27:40	kumul	lots of swap space
2013-01-03 02:27:43	kumul	:)
2013-01-03 02:27:46	tangentstorm	some people try to catch spammers that way: setting up a site with a bunch of fake email addresses, and getting them to crawl it, and serving the pages slower and slower
2013-01-03 02:28:03	tangentstorm	yes, but do you actively manage your swap space in your brain?
2013-01-03 02:28:16	tangentstorm	(you can swap to paper or screen or anything in your visual field)
2013-01-03 02:28:58	tangentstorm	if you *do* actively manage your own mental swap space, then you are taking resources away from understanding the problem, but you're probably better off. i just have never been terribly good at it :/
2013-01-03 02:29:15	tangentstorm	so i go around and around in circles and seem to be doing 50 things at once
2013-01-03 02:29:27	tangentstorm	but really it's just one thing :)
2013-01-03 02:29:36	kumul	hey im just suggesting stuff to demotivate you
2013-01-03 02:30:38	kumul	no a way to write graphs, what kind though?

2013-01-05 23:41:51	Z_Mass	If I have a small html with has a form with a submit button that loads a php file, is there anything I have to put in the html to tell the browser that the file should be opened, not downloaded?
2013-01-05 23:42:24	Z_Mass	I'm not running a websever, just opening ~/path/to/html in firefox (chromium does the same)
2013-01-05 23:44:05	Z_Mass	Oh wait it seems I missed the small paragraph saying I need a webserver to run the examples in the book.. -_-
2013-01-05 23:44:38	chance`	php requires a web server
2013-01-05 23:44:41	chance`	mod_php
2013-01-05 23:44:48	chance`	for apache
2013-01-05 23:44:54	Z_Mass	Would something like flask or sinatra be the easiest way to do this?
2013-01-05 23:45:08	chance`	flask..or sinatra..for php..?
2013-01-05 23:45:21	jfredett	neither of those things are servers, afaik
2013-01-05 23:45:28	jfredett	i know sinatra isn't
2013-01-05 23:45:38	chance`	those are wsgi applications
2013-01-05 23:45:40	jfredett	(I presume it is a requirement to run the php)
2013-01-05 23:45:42	Z_Mass	Oh, right. I'm a total web dev noob :)
2013-01-05 23:45:48	chance`	install apache
2013-01-05 23:45:52	jfredett	yar
2013-01-05 23:45:55	chance`	or wamp if your on windows
2013-01-05 23:46:48	Z_Mass	Gotcha.
2013-01-05 23:47:58	Z_Mass	Does mod_php come bundled with apache? It's not listed in pacman
2013-01-05 23:49:06	Expez	jfredett: Are you aware of any programs which help you get different views of a code base?  The goal being make it easier to get familiar with a project.
2013-01-05 23:49:28	Expez	Z_Mass: You have to install php
2013-01-05 23:49:28	chance`	Z_Mass: take a look at installing apache and php on the arch wiki
2013-01-05 23:49:38	chance`	all the stuff your trying to do is very very googlable :p
2013-01-05 23:49:59	Expez	Z_Mass: Arch has an article on setting up a LAMP server (linux apache mysql php), you could read parts of that.
2013-01-05 23:50:29	Z_Mass	php is already installed. Ya I just remebered that term, lamp, trying to search it now
2013-01-05 23:50:50	Z_Mass	Gf is going crazy on torrents so I can't do much right now :P
2013-01-05 23:51:44	chance`	lol.
2013-01-05 23:51:49	chance`	its all on the arch wiki
2013-01-05 23:52:04	chance`	you need to adjust some files so its enabled, and then restart apache. but after that you'll be good
2013-01-05 23:52:11	chance`	you'll prob want to enable mysql with apache too
2013-01-05 23:52:32	Expez	The arch wiki is so good it's actually a great reason to use Arch
2013-01-05 23:53:41	Z_Mass	Ya just got the lamp arch wiki page up. 
2013-01-05 23:54:05	Z_Mass	Expez: Indeed, it's part of the reason I switched back from Mint. I kept searching stuff and ending up on the arch forums/wiki
2013-01-06 00:20:30	SirSkids|Zzz	I couldn't sleep
2013-01-06 00:20:41	SirSkids|Zzz	Percival is bothering me
2013-01-06 00:20:49	jfredett	howso?
2013-01-06 00:21:01	jfredett	is he calling people again?
2013-01-06 00:21:02	SirSkids|Zzz	jfredett: I can't get my instance of it running at all
2013-01-06 00:21:09	jfredett	hmm
2013-01-06 00:21:10	SirSkids|Zzz	like it runs
2013-01-06 00:21:15	SirSkids|Zzz	but I can't get commands to work
2013-01-06 00:21:26	jfredett	what commands?
2013-01-06 00:21:27	SirSkids|Zzz	any of them!
2013-01-06 00:21:31	jfredett	hmm
2013-01-06 00:21:41	SirSkids|Zzz	(I added myself to the list of approved users)
2013-01-06 00:21:59	SirSkids|Zzz	I was making a guessing game
2013-01-06 00:22:58	jfredett	hmm
2013-01-06 00:23:29	SirSkids|Zzz	the prefix for commands is ! right?
2013-01-06 00:23:30	jfredett	should be
2013-01-06 00:23:52	SirSkids|Zzz	which of the commands work as of now?
2013-01-06 00:24:10	jfredett	uhm... I think !quote should work
2013-01-06 00:24:19	jfredett	!help
2013-01-06 00:24:20	hamper2	Available commands
2013-01-06 00:24:20	hamper2	Dice - Roll dice by saying !XdY+Z.
2013-01-06 00:24:20	hamper2	lmgtfy - Show someone where to find something.
2013-01-06 00:24:20	hamper2	s/find/replace/ - Perform sed style find and replace.
2013-01-06 00:24:20	hamper2	plugins subcommand - See extended help for more details.
2013-01-06 00:24:20	hamper2	help [command] - Show help for commands.
2013-01-06 00:24:20	SirSkids|Zzz	oh
2013-01-06 00:24:20	SirSkids|Zzz	heh
2013-01-06 00:24:21	jfredett	er
2013-01-06 00:24:23	jfredett	that's hamper
2013-01-06 00:24:29	SirSkids|Zzz	yeah
2013-01-06 00:24:55	jfredett	maybe it's not the right prefix...
2013-01-06 00:25:29	SirSkids|Zzz	! is the prefix for the other Cinch bots I found online
2013-01-06 00:25:48	jfredett	hmm
2013-01-06 00:25:51	jfredett	!quote
2013-01-06 00:26:10	jfredett	weird, i think that should give a random quote
2013-01-06 00:26:19	SirSkids|Zzz	also why is there so many commands in the repo that we don't need?
2013-01-06 00:26:23	SirSkids|Zzz	like all this clock crap
2013-01-06 00:27:01	SirSkids|Zzz	I was going to make a branch
2013-01-06 00:27:10	SirSkids|Zzz	and just kinda clean everything up a little bit
2013-01-06 00:27:30	jfredett	So, the clock crap was the original reason I wrote the bot
2013-01-06 00:27:30	jfredett	:)
2013-01-06 00:27:30	SirSkids|Zzz	to the point where we just got it to a clean repo.. with onlly things we needed
2013-01-06 00:27:31	SirSkids|Zzz	jfredett: oh
2013-01-06 00:27:33	SirSkids|Zzz	hehe
2013-01-06 00:27:42	SirSkids|Zzz	Crap wasn't the right word
2013-01-06 00:27:43	SirSkids|Zzz	sorry
2013-01-06 00:27:45	SirSkids|Zzz	I'm tired
2013-01-06 00:27:53	jfredett	I actually think there's a lot of work to do in re-building the irc framework
2013-01-06 00:27:55	jfredett	no no, it's crap
2013-01-06 00:27:58	jfredett	definitely crap
2013-01-06 00:28:06	jfredett	but crap for a different reason. :)
2013-01-06 00:28:07	SirSkids|Zzz	Like Cinch?
2013-01-06 00:28:16	SirSkids|Zzz	or just IRC in general
2013-01-06 00:28:16	jfredett	yah, cinch is pretty miserable
2013-01-06 00:28:25	jfredett	no, irc is fine, cinch is toast
2013-01-06 00:28:50	jfredett	I'm not entirely sure why things aren't working, but I'm going to have to check it out in the morning, sleepybrain is winning.
2013-01-06 00:29:32	SirSkids|Zzz	There's a ton of IRC frameworks
2013-01-06 00:29:40	SirSkids|Zzz	none of them seem active
2013-01-06 00:29:44	SirSkids|Zzz	maybe that should be our prjuect ;)
2013-01-06 00:29:50	SirSkids|Zzz	shit
2013-01-06 00:29:55	SirSkids|Zzz	s/prjuect/project

2013-01-06 00:30:20	SirSkids|Zzz	whoa
2013-01-06 00:30:22	SirSkids|Zzz	haha
2013-01-06 00:30:26	SirSkids|Zzz	that didn't work at all
2013-01-06 00:30:26	jfredett	that's a pretty weird plugin...
2013-01-06 00:30:36	SirSkids|Zzz	It's neat if you do it write
2013-01-06 00:30:39	SirSkids|Zzz	s/write/right/
2013-01-06 00:30:40	hamper2	SirSkids|Zzz actually meant: It's neat if you do it right
2013-01-06 00:30:46	SirSkids|Zzz	^^
2013-01-06 00:30:48	jfredett	nifty
2013-01-06 00:30:54	jfredett	Ah!
2013-01-06 00:31:09	jfredett	it did the switch on your last statement
2013-01-06 00:31:30	SirSkids|Zzz	twG
2013-01-06 00:31:45	SirSkids|Zzz	YEAH
2013-01-06 00:31:55	SirSkids|Zzz	WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME
2013-01-06 00:32:39	jfredett	anyway- yah, I need to eventually figure out exactly what I want from an IRC framework, presently I'm bogged down under a bunch of other projects.
2013-01-06 00:33:00	SirSkids|Zzz	jfredett: I'll investigate Isaac
2013-01-06 00:33:03	SirSkids|Zzz	I'm bored
2013-01-06 00:34:06	SirSkids|Zzz	it's another irc framework
2013-01-06 00:34:40	jfredett	I'm unlikely to port percy onto anything I wasn't involved in writing at this point, he's been through two so far
2013-01-06 00:35:12	SirSkids|Zzz	and isaac hasn't seen a commit in two years
2013-01-06 00:35:14	SirSkids|Zzz	wtf
2013-01-06 00:35:16	jfredett	yah
2013-01-06 00:35:21	jfredett	projects die a lot
2013-01-06 00:35:31	jfredett	anyway, I think I generally know where to look for the percy problem
2013-01-06 00:36:13	SirSkids|Zzz	I looked for a bit
2013-01-06 00:36:21	SirSkids|Zzz	but not a lot
2013-01-06 00:39:17	SirSkids|Zzz	I got really irritated
2013-01-06 00:39:30	chance`	what might be cool, is setting up twilio with hamper for admins of channels
2013-01-06 00:39:40	chance`	then we could send texts via irc if we wanted to get a hold of someone
2013-01-06 00:39:52	jfredett	yar
2013-01-06 00:40:03	chance`	for example, jfredett.
2013-01-06 00:40:10	chance`	xD
2013-01-06 00:40:20	chance`	since people always seem to be wanting you haha
2013-01-06 00:40:32	SirSkids|Zzz	I think it's just mostly me
2013-01-06 00:40:48	jfredett	everybody wants me. I'm popular
2013-01-06 00:41:00	chance`	*wants*
2013-01-06 00:41:55	SirSkids|Zzz	so, jfredett I was peeking around Go today
2013-01-06 00:42:03	SirSkids|Zzz	I didn't get very far, because I fell asleep
2013-01-06 00:42:29	SirSkids|Zzz	and then when I woke up I couldn't concentrate on reading new things
2013-01-06 00:44:16	SirSkids|Zzz	So I started poking around Percival
2013-01-06 00:44:20	SirSkids|Zzz	and then got frustrated
2013-01-06 00:44:40	jfredett	hehe, it's important to take breaks
2013-01-06 00:44:58	SirSkids|Zzz	all in all
2013-01-06 00:45:01	SirSkids|Zzz	was not a productive day
2013-01-06 00:45:15	jfredett	nonproductive days are a good thing
2013-01-06 00:46:32	chance`	SirSkids|Zzz: i had a week of no productive code written when I started my new job
2013-01-06 00:46:33	SirSkids|Zzz	I wanted it to be one though
2013-01-06 00:46:51	SirSkids|Zzz	I cleared my schedule to at least one thing done
2013-01-06 00:46:58	SirSkids|Zzz	got nothing done
2013-01-06 00:47:00	chance`	i was familar with django, and familiar with the project (relatively), but getting new things done is really hard.
2013-01-06 00:47:01	SirSkids|Zzz	haha
2013-01-06 00:47:09	chance`	especially if your new
2013-01-06 00:47:09	jfredett	it's true
2013-01-06 00:47:12	-->	jdrobertso (~jdroberts@d27-96-229-128.evv.wideopenwest.com) has joined #lpmc
2013-01-06 00:47:55	jfredett	and especially important -- if you're tired, or sick, or even just not in the mood for coding, it's important not to force yourself, you'll just burn out
2013-01-06 00:49:23	jfredett	burnout is a bad time
2013-01-06 00:49:34	SirSkids|Zzz	I'm just sad because I have english homework to do tomorrow :(
2013-01-06 00:49:43	jdrobertso	Don't be sad. English is fun.
2013-01-06 00:50:21	jfredett	English was one of the most useful classes I took wrt to Comp Sci
2013-01-06 00:51:15	jfredett	Taught me how to organize thoughts, express a thought clearly, and communicate effectively
2013-01-06 00:51:17	Expez	jfredett: What does the ready tag for all the issues in Hatter mean?  You've solved them, but not opted to close the issue yet?
2013-01-06 00:51:32	jfredett	all very valuable skills for CS
2013-01-06 00:51:42	jdrobertso	Valuable skills for life.
2013-01-06 00:51:52	SirSkids|Zzz	my teacher is insane ;)
2013-01-06 00:51:58	jfredett	Expez -- it's actually for hubboard (or something like that) it's a Kanban board that integrates with Github
2013-01-06 00:52:01	jdrobertso	Howso?
2013-01-06 00:52:50	Expez	Def want to get involved in that project, but know absolutely no Go and nothing about email.  Not sure how to contribute, yet.
2013-01-06 00:53:07	jfredett	we'll figure it out, we're still really early in the project
2013-01-06 00:53:21	SirSkids|Zzz	Expez: you're in the same boat as me
2013-01-06 00:53:23	jfredett	`net/mail` is the package we'll probably be working with mostly
2013-01-06 00:53:44	Expez	SirSkids|Zzz: You planning on reading any Go books, or just start writing code and googling _everything_?
2013-01-06 00:53:57	jfredett	Expez: both.
2013-01-06 00:54:14	jfredett	So, my usual process for learning something new is this.
2013-01-06 00:54:24	jfredett	Find all possible research / papers/ books/ etc on the subject
2013-01-06 00:54:26	jfredett	read them
2013-01-06 00:54:29	jfredett	try stuff
2013-01-06 00:54:33	jfredett	read the papers again
2013-01-06 00:54:35	jfredett	repeat
2013-01-06 00:54:38	SirSkids|Zzz	I have found one Go book and it's free
2013-01-06 00:55:10	jfredett	for languages sometimes I like to read the compiler code or other big corpus of code, so I can see how some of the bigger authors think about it
2013-01-06 00:55:31	jfredett	that is sometimes bad (eg, Rails or MRI ruby are terribad)
2013-01-06 00:55:49	jfredett	and other times it's really good (Rubinius is pretty excellent overall)
2013-01-06 00:55:57	chance`	i do that too
2013-01-06 00:56:11	jfredett	so I rely on my experience and gut to tell me when I'm looking at bad / nonidiomatic code.
2013-01-06 00:56:21	chance`	like, i read the django source because its such a huge project, and sometimes I want to use djangos functions when using a different framework
2013-01-06 00:56:33	chance`	it really helps learn the quirks of small things too
2013-01-06 00:56:40	jfredett	Learning is something I'm very interested in on a direct level -- eg, I like to learn about how people learn
2013-01-06 00:56:57	jfredett	so I am careful to analyze how I learn things so that I can optimize it to learn more stuff
2013-01-06 00:57:34	SirSkids|Zzz	so jfredett
2013-01-06 00:57:36	jfredett	a requisite amount of material I need to 'read' (which itself is a process) before I feel knowledgeable on a subject is usually in the 1000-1500 page range
2013-01-06 00:57:39	SirSkids|Zzz	where do we start?
2013-01-06 00:57:50	jfredett	'read'ing is a three step process -- all this is not really on point though
2013-01-06 00:57:51	SirSkids|Zzz	Like that's what I'm having issues deciding
2013-01-06 00:58:01	SirSkids|Zzz	what do we build first?
2013-01-06 00:58:24	SirSkids|Zzz	I've only contributed to already-created projects, very rarely when they're new
2013-01-06 00:58:27	jfredett	SirSkids|Zzz - That's fortunately very easy to figure out.
2013-01-06 00:58:34	jfredett	What does our program do?
2013-01-06 00:58:41	 *	jfredett is being socratic
2013-01-06 00:59:04	<--	ChocolateEClaire (~EmilyClai@71-9-60-209.static.snlo.ca.charter.com) has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
2013-01-06 01:00:29	SirSkids|Zzz	sends/receives emails
2013-01-06 01:01:07	jfredett	Who uses it?
2013-01-06 01:01:14	SirSkids|Zzz	us
2013-01-06 01:01:17	jfredett	Who are we?
2013-01-06 01:01:31	SirSkids|Zzz	Nerds? :P
2013-01-06 01:01:32	SirSkids|Zzz	Developers
2013-01-06 01:01:41	jfredett	One more question -- why are we building it?
2013-01-06 01:01:48	SirSkids|Zzz	to learn?
2013-01-06 01:01:48	SirSkids|Zzz	for fun?
2013-01-06 01:01:55	SirSkids|Zzz	a combinaation thereof?
2013-01-06 01:02:04	jfredett	So, "As a Nerd, for fun and learning, I want to send and receive Email"
2013-01-06 01:02:16	SirSkids|Zzz	Pretty much, yeah
2013-01-06 01:02:26	jfredett	So - the first thing to build is a way to send and receive a single email -- so now let's recurse
2013-01-06 01:02:29	jfredett	what's and Email?
2013-01-06 01:02:34	jfredett	s/and/an
2013-01-06 01:02:51	SirSkids|Zzz	electronic mail
2013-01-06 01:03:03	SirSkids|Zzz	at its simplest
2013-01-06 01:03:11	jfredett	what's a Email comprised of?
2013-01-06 01:03:49	Z_Mass	I just did chmod o+x ~ then read the next part saying it was not very secure. Is there an oposite mode to o+x?
2013-01-06 01:04:05	jfredett	chmod o-x
2013-01-06 01:04:19	Z_Mass	Oh, cool, that's easy :)
2013-01-06 01:04:20	Z_Mass	Thanks
2013-01-06 01:05:22	jfredett	SirSkids|Zzz -- it's okay if at some point you have to say, "I don't know" -- we've solved the problem, the answer would be "Learn the answer to that question"
2013-01-06 01:05:52	SirSkids|Zzz	It has a recepient, subject, and body
2013-01-06 01:05:53	SirSkids|Zzz	sorry I zoned out there for a second
2013-01-06 01:06:12	jfredett	the idea that I'm running down is "Look at the user story -- then look at the actors in that story (in our case, us and the emails)"
2013-01-06 01:06:14	Expez	Should we set up a mailing list or something?  I know you guys have been talking on Skype, but I would really like if the important stuff was discussed asynchronously and had an URL for future reference.
2013-01-06 01:06:32	jfredett	we have lpmc-<something>
2013-01-06 01:06:35	jfredett	I forget what it is...
2013-01-06 01:06:41	SirSkids|Zzz	Expez: we also were using subjects
2013-01-06 01:06:46	SirSkids|Zzz	isses
2013-01-06 01:06:48	SirSkids|Zzz	i mean
2013-01-06 01:06:52	SirSkids|Zzz	issues
2013-01-06 01:08:04	SirSkids|Zzz	So, the first thing to do
2013-01-06 01:08:24	jfredett	"for those actors, ask what those things are, and describe them until I don't know what it is, then find out"
2013-01-06 01:08:32	SirSkids|Zzz	would be to make a program that, can send one email
2013-01-06 01:08:33	@intothev01d	https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/lpmc-public
2013-01-06 01:08:34	hamper2	intothev01d's shortened url is http://bit.ly/V276Pa
2013-01-06 01:08:42	jfredett	"when I know what all the things are, then use those stories to drive my development"
2013-01-06 01:08:42	SirSkids|Zzz	or receive the most recent email
2013-01-06 01:08:54	jfredett	SirSkids|Zzz I think it's even simpler than that
2013-01-06 01:09:04	jfredett	we need a program which can read a Mail from the filesystem
2013-01-06 01:09:06	SirSkids|Zzz	then bing those to ncurses
2013-01-06 01:09:12	jfredett	and print that mail back out
2013-01-06 01:09:17	jfredett	in an ncurses windo
2013-01-06 01:09:20	jfredett	w
2013-01-06 01:09:25	jfredett	eg, a 'mailview' program
2013-01-06 01:09:32	SirSkids|Zzz	also intothev01d is all discussion taking place on the public lpmc
2013-01-06 01:09:51	jfredett	that will build us the fundamental email object, with all the methods we need  to talk about emails
2013-01-06 01:10:08	SirSkids|Zzz	ah
2013-01-06 01:10:10	SirSkids|Zzz	okay
2013-01-06 01:10:28	@intothev01d	i guess so? we have the admin channel for whatever between the group about stuff for lpmc. i think projects should go in the public channel, so everyone can see info regarding them
2013-01-06 01:10:38	SirSkids|Zzz	okay
2013-01-06 01:11:14	@intothev01d	speaking of groups, what happened with the Nomic game?
2013-01-06 01:11:55	SirSkids|Zzz	intothev01d: we unofficially stopped for the holiday
2013-01-06 01:11:59	@intothev01d	ah
2013-01-06 01:12:01	@intothev01d	gotcha
2013-01-06 01:12:07	SirSkids|Zzz	I was going ot post in it tomorrow
2013-01-06 01:12:12	@intothev01d	cool
2013-01-06 01:12:43	SirSkids|Zzz	so I'm actually starting to get sleepy again
2013-01-06 01:12:50	SirSkids|Zzz	I'm gonna try to turn in again
2013-01-06 01:13:02	SirSkids|Zzz	good night
2013-01-06 01:13:12	jfredett	fsure
2013-01-06 01:13:22	jfredett	night dude
2013-01-06 01:14:33	@intothev01d	is the Hatter email client going to be something you guys use through like a console or are you going to create some sort of gui mabye web interface for it?
2013-01-06 01:14:52	jfredett	it's going to be a CLI client
2013-01-06 01:14:56	@intothev01d	ah
2013-01-06 01:15:07	jfredett	but, there should be no reason someone couldn't build a different interface for it later
2013-01-06 01:15:07	Expez	If someone wants to make a GUI they could do that just fine
2013-01-06 01:15:09	jfredett	web or gui or w/e
2013-01-06 01:15:27	jfredett	the main goal is to have a send + display email program
2013-01-06 01:15:28	@intothev01d	yea just curious, didnt know how you were thinking about setting it up
2013-01-06 01:15:34	jfredett	the receive bit will be getmail
2013-01-06 01:15:41	jfredett	sorting will be procmail or something like it
2013-01-06 01:15:52	jfredett	it's basically mutt, but better
2013-01-06 01:16:32	@intothev01d	so is it going to just use pop or imap?
2013-01-06 01:17:13	jfredett	that's getmail's problem
2013-01-06 01:17:28	jfredett	we will expect mail is on the filesystem in some format (maildir or mbox)
2013-01-06 01:17:30	@intothev01d	so it handles that for it
2013-01-06 01:17:34	jfredett	(or w/e)
2013-01-06 01:17:40	jfredett	mhm
2013-01-06 01:17:41	@intothev01d	cool
2013-01-06 01:17:52	@intothev01d	written in go too huh?
2013-01-06 01:17:59	jfredett	that's the plan
2013-01-06 01:18:05	@intothev01d	should be pretty fast with multiple accounts then right? concurrency and all
2013-01-06 01:18:22	jfredett	mhm
2013-01-06 01:18:30	@intothev01d	sounds neat
2013-01-06 01:18:44	jfredett	it's totally separated from the sorting / receiving of email
2013-01-06 01:19:01	@intothev01d	i watched the intro video to go about it and played around with the tutorial a bit but that was about it
2013-01-06 01:19:04	@intothev01d	right
2013-01-06 01:19:12	jfredett	it's pretty fun
2013-01-06 01:19:22	@intothev01d	what part is separated?
2013-01-06 01:19:57	jfredett	so - the pipeline is : getmail -> <sorter> -> filesystem -> Hatter -> sendmail
2013-01-06 01:20:12	@intothev01d	ah
2013-01-06 01:20:22	jfredett	we're just building hatter.
2013-01-06 01:20:32	jfredett	and maybe including the sendmail functionality into Hatter
2013-01-06 01:20:52	@intothev01d	the getmail is written in go then? or are you writting Hatter in go
2013-01-06 01:21:06	jfredett	no, getmail is a separate unix tool
2013-01-06 01:21:09	jfredett	old as dirt
2013-01-06 01:21:13	@intothev01d	ah ok
2013-01-06 01:21:21	jfredett	the <sorter> is also another program
2013-01-06 01:21:22	jfredett	procmail is the unix standard
2013-01-06 01:22:23	jfredett	I built `sortah`
2013-01-06 01:22:54	<--	factory80 (~factory80@108-70-84-224.lightspeed.gdrpmi.sbcglobal.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
2013-01-06 01:23:13	jfredett	which is a DSL based approach in ruby
2013-01-06 01:23:34	jfredett	but it won't matter what you use, it's a unix philosophy approach.
2013-01-06 01:25:45	jfredett	and really, 'getmail' or any other component in that pipeline is replacable
2013-01-06 01:42:11	jfredett	I'm buggering off to sleep now
2013-01-06 01:42:14	jfredett	night folks

2013-01-06 03:36:04	Expez	Idiomatic go code is indented 8 spaces.  Not sure why they would do that :(
2013-01-06 03:37:05	Expez	In Code Complete references are made to some studies on indentation.  2-4 spaces had best readability.
2013-01-06 03:37:17	Expez	Of the two I prefer 2 spaces for C code
2013-01-06 03:37:59	Expez	Only project I know of that uses 8 spaces is the linux kernel
2013-01-06 03:47:50	Expez	Really like how gofmt is part of the go tools--can use that prior to commits to enforce project wide coding standards

2013-01-06 18:52:49	@intothev01d	got kind of burnt out
2013-01-06 18:53:30	SirSkidmore	ah
2013-01-06 18:53:35	SirSkidmore	I was just wondering
2013-01-06 18:54:10	@intothev01d	yea I was looking into flask-security and stuff and then kind of got distracted with finals and stuff
2013-01-06 18:57:50	SirSkidmore	definitely understandable
2013-01-06 19:09:13	Z_Mass	Anyone ever try to install linux on a headless lan pc? 
2013-01-06 19:09:54	Z_Mass	Is it worth the hassle? I don't have a vga cable atm for it
2013-01-06 19:09:59	tangentstorm	no, but i've removed the monitor once i had it installed
2013-01-06 19:10:19	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: Ya that's my plan for it as well once it's up and running
2013-01-06 19:10:22	SirSkidmore	one sec

2013-01-06 19:12:01	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: I have an lcd monitor, but no vga cable for it at the moment (it's an older pc). I plan on running it with no monitor in the future, but just wondering if it's possible to install linux on it w/ no monitor
2013-01-06 19:13:02	chance`	its possible if it supports all the required features, but i can almost gaurentee it doesnt
2013-01-06 19:13:11	chance`	but at a minimum you probably need pxe booting
2013-01-06 19:13:21	chance`	which, well you have to have a screen for the bios to do
2013-01-06 19:13:23	chance`	lol
2013-01-06 19:13:37	chance`	or an expensive piece of hardware thats used for servers to do it all remotely
2013-01-06 19:13:54	chance`	why not move your current monitor temporarily, just long enough to get networking + SSH
2013-01-06 19:14:03	Z_Mass	chance`: Lack of problem cabling :)
2013-01-06 19:14:17	chance`	ohh i see
2013-01-06 19:14:50	Z_Mass	I'll just wait then lol. Hopefully I can find one in the pc junk pile at my parents 
2013-01-06 19:15:04	SirSkidmore	I have a ton
2013-01-06 19:15:14	SirSkidmore	that doesn't really help though

2013-01-06 19:17:31	@intothev01d	chance` weren't you talking about Mosh a while back?
2013-01-06 19:17:31	chance`	its nice to buy a small plastic bin, go to monoprice and get like 2 of all types of cables
2013-01-06 19:17:34	chance`	pretty cheap
2013-01-06 19:17:36	chance`	intothev01d: yeah
2013-01-06 19:17:42	@intothev01d	have you used it?

2013-01-08 19:01:17	SirSkidmore	org-mode?
2013-01-08 19:01:31	SirSkidmore	I liked it when I used it, especially being able to push it to my phone
2013-01-08 19:02:45	SirSkidmore	what's so special about it though?
2013-01-08 19:07:24	tangentwork	SirSkidmore: check out this website: http://javascriptgamer.com/brickslayer/trail/
2013-01-08 19:07:28	hamper2	tangentwork's shortened url is http://bit.ly/XKqXZU
2013-01-08 19:07:40	tangentwork	ignore the game and my crappy javascript code
2013-01-08 19:08:09	tangentwork	what's interesting is that the source is built up in pieces over the course of the lessons
2013-01-08 19:08:27	tangentwork	on each page there is a snapshot of the code as it is at that point in time
2013-01-08 19:08:53	SirSkidmore	okay
2013-01-08 19:08:54	SirSkidmore	neat
2013-01-08 19:08:58	tangentwork	and like on this page, for example: http://javascriptgamer.com/brickslayer/trail/08-screens.html
2013-01-08 19:08:58	hamper2	tangentwork's shortened url is http://bit.ly/XKrhYC
2013-01-08 19:09:09	tangentwork	you can see that a couple lines have been scratched out
2013-01-08 19:09:48	tangentwork	the idea is that you aren't just editing the code but walking people through how it was created
2013-01-08 19:10:10	tangentwork	sort of like literate programming + version control
2013-01-08 19:10:40	SirSkidmore	that crappy javascript game totally crashed Firefox
2013-01-08 19:10:42	SirSkidmore	lol
2013-01-08 19:11:08	tangentwork	what's missing from the tool that created that site was the ability to also work on it from outside the narrative
2013-01-08 19:11:09	tangentwork	that's why you have to ditch the filesystem and use a database
2013-01-08 19:11:38	tangentwork	editor + database + version control + scripting engine  = minneron
2013-01-08 19:11:55	tangentwork	also peer to peer interaction but i haven't gotte that far
2013-01-08 19:12:18	tangentwork	MINimal NEtworked enviRONment
2013-01-08 19:12:40	SirSkidmore	neat
2013-01-08 19:12:42	SirSkidmore	for sure
2013-01-08 19:12:48	tangentwork	the javascript game's about to be re-written
2013-01-08 19:12:55	SirSkidmore	I'll check it out when it's ready
2013-01-08 19:13:10	tangentwork	:)

2013-01-08 21:49:25	Z_Mass	I have to read the contents of one file into another. What would be quicker: Read the full file into a container, then write all at once, or for each line read, write that line immediately?
2013-01-08 21:49:56	Z_Mass	I don't really need the peformance, just curious.
2013-01-08 21:50:51	@intothev01d	probably read the whole file then write
2013-01-08 21:51:04	@intothev01d	you dont have nearly as much disk access/seek time etc
2013-01-08 21:51:17	@intothev01d	only downside is that you'd have to have enough memory to store the file in, which if it's small no biggie
2013-01-08 21:51:44	tangentwork	yep
2013-01-08 21:51:54	tangentwork	or read a block at a time
2013-01-08 21:52:45	Z_Mass	Hmm, makes sense. Thanks :)
2013-01-08 21:53:29	Z_Mass	I'm bored so I'm over engineering my labs :P
2013-01-08 21:54:24	@intothev01d	if you're really bored, do them both to time and compare :D
2013-01-08 21:54:34	@intothev01d	we had a similar exercise this year in class
2013-01-08 21:54:50	Z_Mass	lol good idea. I just found a SO page comparing a bunch
2013-01-08 21:54:54	@intothev01d	the gist is the less access to disk you have, the better
2013-01-08 21:55:24	@intothev01d	cool
2013-01-08 21:55:24	@intothev01d	link?
2013-01-08 21:55:34	Z_Mass	std::ofstream << std::ifstream.rdbuf();   now that's simple lol

2013-01-08 21:55:46	@intothev01d	heck yea
2013-01-08 21:57:14	@intothev01d	fudge. i think i just realized I've been being taught C++ the C way
2013-01-08 21:57:15	@intothev01d	lol
2013-01-08 21:58:02	@intothev01d	well aside from all the class stuff. it was really a mix of both I guess
2013-01-08 21:58:56	Z_Mass	Ya, our teacher is pretty hung up on C style C++ as well..
2013-01-08 22:00:30	Z_Mass	I started playing around with templates though, pretty cool stuff
2013-01-08 22:01:00	@intothev01d	I don't guess it's "bad" per se however it doesn't make much use of what C++ is good for/at if you stick to using the C based approach
2013-01-08 22:01:15	@intothev01d	they're quite different
2013-01-08 22:01:24	@intothev01d	i'm noticing
2013-01-08 22:01:44	@intothev01d	templates are helpful
2013-01-08 22:01:53	@intothev01d	stl anyone?
2013-01-08 22:01:55	@intothev01d	lol
2013-01-08 22:02:46	Z_Mass	Heh
2013-01-08 22:03:12	@intothev01d	have you used boost at all Z_Mass?
2013-01-08 22:03:17	Z_Mass	I've never really had a use for creating my own template before.. Or at least I didn't think about it
2013-01-08 22:03:49	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Yep, actually using boost::property_tree for my "game engine" for programming class
2013-01-08 22:04:05	@intothev01d	cool
2013-01-08 22:04:08	Z_Mass	You?
2013-01-08 22:04:13	Z_Mass	They have everything lol
2013-01-08 22:04:15	@intothev01d	yea we never talked about it but it seems like pretty much the goto library for stuff
2013-01-08 22:04:21	@intothev01d	yea they do
2013-01-08 22:04:42	Z_Mass	If you want to get confused have a look at their date/time stuff 
2013-01-08 22:04:52	SirSkidmore	I wasn't on Dance Moms :(
2013-01-08 22:05:15	SirSkidmore	I went to go watch a dance competition and the Dance Moms people were there
2013-01-08 22:06:31	@intothev01d	you mean the implementation or just using it?
2013-01-08 22:07:07	@intothev01d	what?
2013-01-08 22:07:25	@intothev01d	SirSkidmore, you should have just run out onto the floor or something lol
2013-01-08 22:07:35	SirSkidmore	lol they probably would have cut that ;)
2013-01-08 22:07:46	@intothev01d	never know. look at honey boo boo
2013-01-08 22:07:55	@intothev01d	if that shit can make it on tv, anything can
2013-01-08 22:07:56	Z_Mass	Just using it. They have so many classes for locales and stuff. I remember being pretty overwhelmed looking at the docs before lol
2013-01-08 22:07:59	SirSkidmore	don't even compare that shit to Dance Moms
2013-01-08 22:08:15	@intothev01d	yea it's pretty extensive Z_Mass
2013-01-08 22:08:25	@intothev01d	but I agree, seems like they have something for everything
2013-01-08 22:08:52	@intothev01d	lol, I'm not. I'm just saying if they will put that stuff on tv, you should have a chance :D
2013-01-08 22:09:26	SirSkidmore	touche
2013-01-08 22:10:45	@intothev01d	I would hate to have to write up the documentation for that.. good god
2013-01-08 22:10:55	@intothev01d	it would take longer to write than the code would
2013-01-08 22:13:50	Z_Mass	No kidding.. Plus keeping all the examples up to date. 
2013-01-08 22:16:15	@intothev01d	nope. not gonna happen
2013-01-08 22:16:25	@intothev01d	just read the code lol
2013-01-08 22:16:35	@intothev01d	I'll write self documenting code howaboutit?
2013-01-08 22:16:35	@intothev01d	lol
2013-01-08 22:16:57	Z_Mass	RTFC :P
2013-01-08 22:17:05	@intothev01d	no manual lol
2013-01-08 22:17:27	Z_Mass	Ensures only the elite use it
2013-01-08 22:18:35	@intothev01d	or the insane
2013-01-08 22:19:03	@intothev01d	guess anyone good enough to understand what the code is doing could use it though, if its written well it would be pretty straightforward
2013-01-08 22:19:21	@intothev01d	but yea, i personally would hate having to write the docs, however they are necessary
2013-01-08 22:20:05	@intothev01d	I think there are some tools out there to help with all that as well (writing documentation) dunno b/c I've never done it though
2013-01-08 22:20:31	Z_Mass	Isn't doxygen or something like that used for in code docs for c++
2013-01-08 22:20:53	Z_Mass	I have no clue if boost uses a system like that though
2013-01-08 22:20:53	@intothev01d	looks like it
2013-01-08 22:23:36	@intothev01d	Z_Mass, since you're here now maybe I can sucker you in to watching my demo for this app I'm wanting to release. I wanted to put something out there and have it be semi useful and on my level so I made a number generator for iOS. If you have a second to take a look and give any criticisms/critique I'd appreciate it. you can see it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUWc6isO8bs

2013-01-08 22:24:11	@intothev01d	I hope to sign up for the developer license later this week and hopefully have it released by next week
2013-01-08 22:24:15	@intothev01d	if all goes well
2013-01-08 22:24:27	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Sure, I remember you talking about that.
2013-01-08 22:24:44	Z_Mass	Nice, is that license per app?
2013-01-08 22:25:13	@intothev01d	The ios developer license is good for a year
2013-01-08 22:25:27	@intothev01d	i don't think there is a limit to the amount of apps you can release during that period
2013-01-08 22:25:45	@intothev01d	and if you want to make a mac app, then you have a separate license for that as well
2013-01-08 22:25:53	@intothev01d	both are 100 bucks
2013-01-08 22:26:32	@intothev01d	i'm just sticking with iOS app stuff for now. I did toy around with making like a file syncing app for the mac for a bit, but just got tired of working on it and don't really need it anymore
2013-01-08 22:28:28	Z_Mass	That's not too bad.. Hopefully you can make it back 
2013-01-08 22:28:39	@intothev01d	yea if I can break even I'll be happy
2013-01-08 22:29:03	Z_Mass	Apparently I have to go to Tim Hortons now.. I'll have to watch that when I get back lol
2013-01-08 22:29:05	@intothev01d	I'm only selling it for 0.99 anyway. don't really want to do ads, think it would just clutter it up
2013-01-08 22:29:08	@intothev01d	alright

2013-01-08 23:44:51	@intothev01d	still can
2013-01-08 23:44:59	@intothev01d	or could

2013-01-08 23:45:18	chance	just the service
2013-01-08 23:45:28	@intothev01d	true
2013-01-08 23:45:28	chance	heroku, wewt!
2013-01-08 23:45:38	chance	also, cross platform
2013-01-08 23:45:41	chance	and there are web UI packages for mobile devices
2013-01-08 23:45:50	chance	so that it works more like an 'app'
2013-01-08 23:45:58	@intothev01d	yea
2013-01-08 23:47:12	@intothev01d	do they have any way really yet to cache content enough to work something like that without even being online?

2013-01-08 23:48:42	chance	localstorage is what you'd use mainly
2013-01-08 23:48:48	chance	or a web based sql implementation
2013-01-08 23:49:01	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Just watched the video, looks pretty good. The email thing is pretty slick. Did you have to write that or did ios have an email form

2013-01-08 23:50:03	@intothev01d	no the email thing is native. linking it up to the action and calling it to pull up the email screen i mean is. the part where i write out the numbers to the email is just the first 1,000 in the random array that i put in a string and write to the content of the email
2013-01-08 23:51:08	chance	might look into localdb for storing data temporarily until syncing with the server
2013-01-08 23:51:15	Z_Mass	Ya, that's what I figured. That's neat. 
2013-01-08 23:51:23	Z_Mass	Any plans on an Android port? ;)
2013-01-08 23:51:46	@intothev01d	sure. i take java this semester and mobile development (android) next semester so probably
2013-01-08 23:52:28	@intothev01d	chance for something like this is doesn't even really need to send or receive data so as long as the page is there i guess js would handle the rest to generate stuff

2013-01-08 23:53:29	@intothev01d	yea html5 really opens things up for that kind of stuff
2013-01-08 23:55:44	Z_Mass	Cool. I'd like to try making a simple mobile app eventually.
2013-01-08 23:55:54	Z_Mass	How long did this one take you?
2013-01-08 23:56:08	@intothev01d	about a week
2013-01-08 23:56:19	@intothev01d	my first iPad app took my like 4-5 months though
2013-01-08 23:56:47	@intothev01d	more like the full 5 I think. it was more involved plus I was completely new to the whole thing
2013-01-08 23:57:32	@intothev01d	the best/hardest part is learning how the api all works together
2013-01-08 23:58:19	@intothev01d	just learning the language is one thing. using it then the way they have everything set up is different. however i will say once you do it for one system, you can learn how they do it and it's similar in most respects to how it's done elsewhere
2013-01-08 23:58:28	@intothev01d	not always, but some things
2013-01-08 23:59:38	@intothev01d	Z_Mass, do you know any Java yet?
2013-01-09 00:00:59	Z_Mass	That's not too bad. Ya I remember looking into android development (I don't have an iphone) and it seemed like the api was quite big.
2013-01-09 00:01:32	Z_Mass	Ya, I've messed around in it, I had started working through a book before I found out I would be doing C++ for my program
2013-01-09 00:01:50	@intothev01d	yea they're huge lol. and really grow or change somewhat with each release (things will get depreciated while others get added and stuff)
2013-01-09 00:02:58	@intothev01d	well I take it this semester and I definitely will be doing Android dev in the fall, so I'll get back with you if I port this or work on something else if you're interested
2013-01-09 00:04:47	Z_Mass	Awesome, I'd be down for that. I'll have to download the android vm's or what ever else you need before schools over.
2013-01-09 00:05:31	Z_Mass	I remember it took me forever to download one or two versions before at home. Only get ~200kb/s here -_-
2013-01-09 00:06:03	@intothev01d	ah, yea. i think most people use eclipse as well for it (at least thats what google recommends)
2013-01-09 00:06:29	@intothev01d	so tons of dev tools just to get started lol
2013-01-09 00:06:44	Z_Mass	Don't they have an Android plugin for Eclipse?

2013-01-09 00:07:52	Z_Mass	It's too bad you need to use Eclipse, it's not the most space efficient for laptop screens 
2013-01-09 00:08:20	@intothev01d	these IDE's aren't mobile friendly
2013-01-09 00:08:29	@intothev01d	they just have so much going on
2013-01-09 00:08:36	Z_Mass	At least the stock setup, never messed around with it much. Just tried the terrible C++ mode
2013-01-09 00:08:52	@intothev01d	ugh, yea me too. that was unpleasant
2013-01-09 00:09:01	@intothev01d	i ditched it pretty quick
2013-01-09 00:09:28	Z_Mass	It might of been better if it had C++11 support. The Scons project import was a cool feature.
2013-01-09 00:09:30	@intothev01d	vim and g++ is the way to go for me anymore (of course i don't write much complicated stuff in C++ anyway, just school assignments)
2013-01-09 00:10:01	Z_Mass	Yep, I use clang++ now though, that way you can get code completion without ctags
2013-01-09 00:10:24	Z_Mass	Better error messages too :)
2013-01-09 00:10:51	@intothev01d	huh. yea i've heard better error messages. i think i should have clang++ as I think that's what Apple has moved to anyway
2013-01-09 00:11:14	@intothev01d	how do you get code completion without ctags using clang?
2013-01-09 00:11:31	@intothev01d	i've just been using omnicppcomplete

2013-01-09 12:06:40	Z_Mass	Would returning a 1 for success from a method be good C++ style? Or is that more a C convention?
2013-01-09 12:09:32	Expez	Why do you want to return something to indicate success?
2013-01-09 12:09:50	Expez	Probably better style to assume success and raise an exception if something goes wrong.
2013-01-09 12:10:43	Z_Mass	It's for our first lab, we have to store/read a struct to a file. I'm making a small class to handle it. The use I was thinking for returning 1 would be to do:
2013-01-09 12:11:18	Z_Mass	if (profile.get()) profile.pretty_print();
2013-01-09 12:12:18	Z_Mass	So dumping an error message and calling exit(EXIT_FAILURE) would be better? (that was my initial design)
2013-01-09 12:13:17	Expez	I would make a profile constructor with a file as argument, to create a profile by reading a file
2013-01-09 12:13:34	Expez	then once you have the profile object you can call profile.pretty_print
2013-01-09 12:14:42	Expez	It can be awkward when you have empty constructors because people might use the class without calling the profile.get method to populate the class fields
2013-01-09 12:15:18	Expez	principle of least astonishment to remove the profile.get method by havine a constructor with either reads from file or accepts the fields needed to instantiate the class
2013-01-09 12:15:31	Z_Mass	Hmm.. That sounds better. Currently my class ProfileManager handles creating a profile struct (cin prompts), writing to file, and reading from file and creating a profile that way as well
2013-01-09 12:15:47	Z_Mass	So I should maybe break that into two classes, right?
2013-01-09 12:16:51	Z_Mass	End result is I need to be able to do main -[c,r] <profilename>

2013-01-09 12:19:27	Expez	The use of the return codes in C is generally because C doesn't have exceptions
2013-01-09 12:20:16	Expez	You should also think about your method names. Profile.get() should probably be called profile.load_from_file() or something so it's possible to guess what the method does without checking the code
2013-01-09 12:20:46	Z_Mass	Makes sense. I figured there was a better way to do it in C++.
2013-01-09 12:20:55	Expez	Realise this is only an exercise, but thinking up good names is so hard and so important that you might as well practice it :P
2013-01-09 12:21:31	jfredett1	Z_Mass: I know unix specifies that 0 is success (eg, the `true` command returns 0), I don't remember if that should carry over into C
2013-01-09 12:21:35	Z_Mass	lol true. I wrote the wrong method name though. Currently the ProfileManager has three public methods. create(), retrieve() and save()
2013-01-09 12:21:44	jfredett1	I think it only has to for main()
2013-01-09 12:22:39	Z_Mass	jfredett1: I've seen it both ways, but I like 1 better, since it's considered true, so you can do if(success()) {..}
2013-01-09 12:23:06	Expez	Z_Mass: any non-zero value, returned from a function, in C is an error code.
2013-01-09 12:23:34	jfredett1	Z_Mass: yah, for some reason C didn't keep the shell convention (which is probably should have)
2013-01-09 12:23:55	Z_Mass	Hmm.. I must be using crappy libraries. Allegro (and I think SDL) seem to return 1 for success
2013-01-09 12:24:03	Expez	jfredett1: We need to get Hatter off the ground
2013-01-09 12:24:24	jfredett1	Expez: yah - I'm up against yet-another-deadline at work, which is why I haven't done much
2013-01-09 12:24:57	Expez	jfredett1: Every day is "crunch time"
2013-01-09 12:26:01	jfredett1	Expez: usually not, this project however has my boss seeing green (it's 4 devs on a project for a fortune 15 company
2013-01-09 12:26:09	jfredett1	)
2013-01-09 12:26:23	jfredett1	so we're killing ourselves as he oversells everything to the client
2013-01-09 12:26:31	Expez	lol
2013-01-09 12:26:33	jfredett1	I'm slowwalking this one though
2013-01-09 12:26:59	jfredett1	but that takes some effort, have to look busy without being busy
2013-01-09 12:28:41	Expez	Depending on your boss' technical skills working on Hatter might fit the bill.  Does code look like code to him? :P
2013-01-09 12:29:04	jfredett1	Yah
2013-01-09 12:29:11	jfredett1	he's one of the devs on the project
2013-01-09 12:29:19	jfredett1	we're a pretty flat company. :)
2013-01-09 12:29:53	jfredett1	presently I have convinced him that I need to rebuild a reasonable portion of the infrastructure of this backbone app (which I kind of have to)
2013-01-09 12:30:12	jfredett1	Basically, I've convinced him the right way is the only way
2013-01-09 12:30:21	jfredett1	when in reality there are half a dozen shite ways to fix it

2013-01-12 01:24:54	Z_Mass	Commenting school labs -_-
2013-01-12 01:24:55	Z_Mass	you?

2013-01-12 01:26:06	Z_Mass	? ?
2013-01-12 01:26:22	chance	commenting school labs?
2013-01-12 01:27:10	Z_Mass	For database class. We need to have comment headers on each function
2013-01-12 01:30:30	chance	why did you do it before you write the code
2013-01-12 01:30:49	Z_Mass	I didn't :)
2013-01-12 01:31:41	chance	d/did/didn't/
2013-01-12 01:31:46	Z_Mass	I had the code finished a few days ago, just been procrastinating on documenting it. It's 2 week lab due the 24th, took me 1 night to write it..
2013-01-12 01:32:01	chance	s/did you/didn't you/
2013-01-12 01:32:01	hamper2	chance actually meant: why didn't you do it before you write the code
2013-01-12 01:32:49	Z_Mass	Ah, because it was simple stuff like, read a file and display its output, or copy one file to another
2013-01-12 01:40:25	chance	mm, i suppose.
2013-01-12 01:40:41	chance	i tend to comment simple code, even if people wont use it
2013-01-12 01:40:41	chance	like if its just for me
2013-01-12 01:40:48	chance	because it makes going back to it later easier
2013-01-12 01:42:14	Z_Mass	Ya, I try to write self documenting code as much as possible, and throw a few comments as needed within the functions. For some reason they're hung up on us following their comment style and having function headers

2013-01-13 21:18:07	Z_Mass	Do you guys think Ubuntu Server LTS would be better than Arch to put on an old pc to use as a server
2013-01-13 21:21:08	intothev01d_m	I don't have enough experience with the 2 to say really
2013-01-13 21:21:20	intothev01d_m	I though Arch was sometimes less stable though right?
2013-01-13 21:22:23	Z_Mass	Ya, it's slightly less stable, they don't patch the packages as much as other distros so they come out quicker
2013-01-13 21:22:58	intothev01d_m	ah
2013-01-13 21:23:08	Z_Mass	Main advantages for arch are rolling release + aur. 
2013-01-13 21:24:07	Z_Mass	But I imagine ubuntu is a pretty rock solid.. I've got two clunkers, maybe I'll just try both out, see which one crashes first lol
2013-01-13 21:24:09	intothev01d_m	I personally prefer stability/realiability so I'd choose that between them
2013-01-13 21:24:16	intothev01d_m	reliability*
2013-01-13 21:24:38	intothev01d_m	thats a good idea. put them to the test!!! :D
2013-01-13 21:24:41	intothev01d_m	that would be a good blog post as well, if you have one
2013-01-13 21:24:57	Z_Mass	lol that's true. 
2013-01-13 21:25:08	Z_Mass	I do have one, just never think of posting to it
2013-01-13 21:25:28	intothev01d_m	yea me too. always busy working on stuff to put any time aside to write
2013-01-13 21:25:43	intothev01d_m	i should though, feel like i need to give back a bit considering how much I've learned from random ones in the past
2013-01-13 21:26:16	SirSkidmore	my minecraft server is running ubuntu LTS but my webserver is on Arch
2013-01-13 21:26:21	SirSkidmore	Honestly, neither have had any problems
2013-01-13 21:26:31	intothev01d_m	SirSkidmore for the win!
2013-01-13 21:27:06	SirSkidmore	I did have some weird networking issues with ubuntu initially that took a day to work out all the kinks
2013-01-13 21:27:19	SirSkidmore	but it was pretty easy once I found the right docs.
2013-01-13 21:27:20	Z_Mass	Nice. Does minecraft need a fairly good machine for it's server?
2013-01-13 21:27:39	SirSkidmore	Not for the 6 people that play on mine
2013-01-13 21:28:19	SirSkidmore	The biggest thing beyong the AUR Arch has going for it is honestly its wiki
2013-01-13 21:28:22	Z_Mass	Would a 1.2ghz 256mb ram pc do the trick? :P
2013-01-13 21:28:34	SirSkidmore	I ran on 512 for a while
2013-01-13 21:28:40	Z_Mass	Hmm, that's not bad.
2013-01-13 21:28:49	SirSkidmore	I think mine has 1.4
2013-01-13 21:28:53	SirSkidmore	Ghz
2013-01-13 21:29:18	Z_Mass	Btw, stay away from the dell mini towers -_-
2013-01-13 21:29:49	intothev01d_m	stay away from the dell --- fixed that for you
2013-01-13 21:29:49	intothev01d_m	:D
2013-01-13 21:29:49	SirSkidmore	But I mean, I cannot possibly talk about how much I LOVE the Arch Wiki
2013-01-13 21:29:49	SirSkidmore	lol
2013-01-13 21:30:15	Z_Mass	I got it with the hard drive removed, and when I put it back in, the stupid ide cables were in the way of it closing (it's like a hinge, all one piece)
2013-01-13 21:30:29	Z_Mass	Ya, Arch Wiki is great :)
2013-01-13 21:31:27	Z_Mass	intothev01d_m: lol, ya that's probably good advice. Although my XPS is still holding up after 4 years 
2013-01-13 21:31:49	intothev01d_m	I had an XPS for about 5, then the mobo went out
2013-01-13 21:31:56	intothev01d_m	it was good while it lasted
2013-01-13 21:32:44	Z_Mass	Only thing that died on mine was my second nvidia card.. Didn't even get an FPS drop

2013-01-13 21:33:07	intothev01d_m	well then it wasn't doing much good in the first place lol :D
2013-01-13 21:33:29	intothev01d_m	but they aren't terrible. i think hp is much worse. but I won't get into all that
2013-01-13 21:33:49	intothev01d_m	of course, both companies were way better a long time ago
2013-01-13 21:33:59	intothev01d_m	My first computer was actually a Gateway
2013-01-13 21:34:23	Z_Mass	hah, so was mine
2013-01-13 21:34:39	intothev01d_m	yea they used to be good too
2013-01-13 21:34:40	intothev01d_m	now everything is kind of shit
2013-01-13 21:34:40	Z_Mass	Got it from Costco :D
2013-01-13 21:35:59	chance	Z_Mass: centos
2013-01-13 21:36:09	chance	for a server.
2013-01-13 21:36:11	chance	imo
2013-01-13 21:37:01	Z_Mass	chance: Any big advantages?
2013-01-13 21:37:05	chance	no
2013-01-13 21:37:19	chance	its just stable
2013-01-13 21:37:38	chance	its a very well supported OS, thats a part of the RHEL family
2013-01-13 21:37:53	Z_Mass	Gotcha. Well for now I'll get arch going since I have the iso + free time to do it
2013-01-13 21:37:59	chance	debian works really well too, lately i've been disliking ubuntu
2013-01-13 21:38:09	Z_Mass	I'll give that one a shot for second pc though 
2013-01-13 21:38:14	chance	i use arch on my daily laptop
2013-01-13 21:38:29	chance	but you just have to be careful with updates, if its something core, look it up first, read the arch news
2013-01-13 21:38:30	Z_Mass	Same, I haven't had any problems.
2013-01-13 21:38:42	chance	although that isn't to say that I'd use it for a server.
2013-01-13 21:39:28	Z_Mass	Only problem I've had with arch was over the summer they did some update that required moving /usr/bin or something, and I moved the wrong one. ls & cd were not recognized commands -_-

2013-01-15 16:18:11	jazztoken	Ok, simple question- is there a reason to not pass a null argument into a method (as long as the method knows it could recieve one)?
2013-01-15 16:26:14	SirSkids|Away	I know you can in C++

2013-01-15 16:43:10	jfredett	NullObject is the best object
2013-01-15 16:53:07	tangentstorm	not completely thrilled with this, but i now have a generic abstract sequence type with generic cursors: https://github.com/tangentstorm/xpl/blob/master/code/sq.pas

2013-01-15 16:59:15	tangentstorm	if i specialize the type to variant, i should be able to make an arbitrary document type that lets me curse over linear text, nested elements, and multi-column tables of data

2013-01-15 21:13:27	tangentstorm	you know what was convenient? parallel ports :)
2013-01-15 21:13:57	Z_Mass	I've only used those with old printers lol
2013-01-15 21:14:33	tangentstorm	when i was in high school, we had a "research and development" class full of computers
2013-01-15 21:15:51	tangentstorm	i was programming in turbo pascal, and I had a friend who did electronics ... we worked together and hooked a couple stepper motors up to the pc through the parallel port
2013-01-15 21:17:13	tangentstorm	nowhere near as advanced as usb, but in terms of just hooking up pins to a circuit, it was pretty hard to beat
2013-01-15 21:17:52	Z_Mass	Nice, were they powered by the pc too?
2013-01-15 21:18:43	Z_Mass	I think I remember reading something about making an AVR programmer using a parallel cable and a few resistors
2013-01-15 21:25:06	tangentstorm	i don't remember whether they were powered by the pc or not. i don't think the current coming out of the parallel port was strong enough to do that though
2013-01-15 21:25:35	tangentstorm	i still have the pascal code but i don't have anything about the circuit
2013-01-15 21:26:15	tangentstorm	it was cool though, because you could just write a number to the port and the bits of the number would map to which pins were turned on and which were off.
2013-01-15 21:28:05	tangentstorm	https://github.com/tangentstorm/silverware/blob/master/work/step2.pas ... good times

2013-01-15 23:26:33	jazztoken	If I'm writing a program and a non-technical writer wants to contribute, what's the process for that? If I'm releasing it open source, am I going to hit any snags, or am I just overthinking it, as usual?
2013-01-15 23:27:49	jazztoken	Essentially, while the writer may agree to help me, I'd rather he knows up front that another company can take and sell (MIT license) our work with some modifications, even if it's ultimately never going to happen.
2013-01-15 23:36:36	Z_Mass	I've never dealt much with licenses, but I imagine if you have a file with your license in the project root it's his responsibility to check it out.
2013-01-15 23:36:51	Z_Mass	And by contributing he would in essence be agreeing with it

2013-01-19 12:24:45	Z_Mass	I haven't had much luck with C++ IDE's, vim does just fine. I'm not sure I'd write Java in vim though lol
2013-01-19 12:25:08	@intothev01d	visual studio is pretty good for C++
2013-01-19 12:25:32	@intothev01d	kind of overkill though for most stuff besides a larger project
2013-01-19 12:26:27	Z_Mass	I have a free copy of VS from that webspark thing, but it's horribly slow
2013-01-19 12:26:29	--	tangentsleep is now known as tangentstorm
2013-01-19 12:28:13	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Have you done much Android yet? Would I be fine playing around with it without much base Java knowledge?
2013-01-19 12:28:33	biio	I haven't tried the 2012 version, but I've never felt that the previous versions of VS has been slow
2013-01-19 12:30:15	Z_Mass	biio: I believe that's the version I have. Mind you I boot windows about twice a month, and it hasn't been re-installed in about 2 years
2013-01-19 12:30:40	@intothev01d	I have not done any Android dev yet. I don't think it would hurt, considering you have a good knowledge of programming anyway. I plan on using Eclipse this semester for Java myself, rather than trying to just use a text editor
2013-01-19 12:30:42	Z_Mass	It takes me about 5 minutes from poweron to be able to open my start bar :D
2013-01-19 12:33:00	Z_Mass	Cool, I'll have to get those giant sdk's downloaded lol. Maybe I can get my android to turn on a LED with my arduino
2013-01-19 12:35:58	SirSkidmore	Winodws 8 is actually pretty quick to boot
2013-01-19 12:36:04	SirSkidmore	almost as fast as my Arch
2013-01-19 12:37:24	SirSkidmore	s/Winodws/Windows/
2013-01-19 12:37:24	tamper	SirSkidmore actually meant: Windows 8 is actually pretty quick to boot
2013-01-19 12:37:34	biio	windows is always fast to boot in the beginning if you haven't had it installed for long, and windows 8 has that new suspend-thing
2013-01-19 12:38:47	Z_Mass	How do you like Win 8? I've seen a few people that have it on new laptops, but they're not touchscreen and it seems kinda clumsy when in the Metro ui
2013-01-19 12:40:32	SirSkidmore	I get by easily
2013-01-19 12:40:33	SirSkidmore	It's not the most efficient
2013-01-19 12:40:41	SirSkidmore	and it works better if you use the keyboard a lot
2013-01-19 12:40:47	SirSkidmore	it's like Win7
2013-01-19 12:40:57	SirSkidmore	windows key -> type app -> enter
2013-01-19 12:42:17	SirSkidmore	I don't use any metro apps though
2013-01-19 12:45:25	Z_Mass	Nothing good in the metro appstore?
2013-01-19 12:46:18	SirSkidmore	haven't even looked
2013-01-19 12:46:22	SirSkidmore	doesn't really appeal to me
2013-01-19 12:46:32	SirSkidmore	the Music app is buggy at all get-out though
2013-01-19 12:51:04	Z_Mass	I guess metro apps are probably more geared towards people with things like their tablet w/ keyboard contraption
2013-01-19 12:54:45	SirSkidmore	I really like the concept of "Live Tiles" though
2013-01-19 12:55:03	SirSkidmore	and if I had their tablet (or the $800 to spend on it) I'm sure I would enjoy it

2013-01-23 21:47:13	tangentstorm	the philosophy was to have all art and logic code look kind of the same, regardless of language.
2013-01-23 21:47:35	tangentstorm	everything was laid out the same way in the project directories, too.
2013-01-23 21:48:08	tangentstorm	it meant that PEP8 was kind of thrown out the window for python
2013-01-23 21:48:27	tangentstorm	but it worked
2013-01-23 21:50:40	Z_Mass	I'm not sure I like prefixing class names with A, but it seems pretty resonable
2013-01-23 21:59:22	tangentstorm	yeah
2013-01-23 21:59:37	tangentstorm	i don't like that in pascal, every type is prefixed with T
2013-01-23 22:00:05	Z_Mass	That could get messy
2013-01-23 22:00:08	tangentstorm	and prior to A&L, I always used the go-style braces
2013-01-23 22:00:20	tangentstorm	pascal is case insensitive
2013-01-23 22:01:17	tangentstorm	so where in python you might say  dog = Dog()  , or java you might say Dog dog = new Dog()...
2013-01-23 22:01:27	tangentstorm	in pascal dog and Dog are the same.
2013-01-23 22:02:37	tangentstorm	it turns out that variables and types have separate namespaces, so you can actually say dog := dog.create; if you want to
2013-01-23 22:03:07	tangentstorm	but borland's coding standard was to prefix the type with "T"...    dog := tdog.create;
2013-01-23 22:03:16	tangentstorm	except they'd actually write   dog := TDog.Create;
2013-01-23 22:04:40	tangentstorm	i had spent a couple years doing turbo pascal 5.5 coding... then i got ahold of 6.0 and all of a sudden there were T's everywhere and i have never liked them :)
2013-01-23 22:05:21	tangentstorm	but borland is the dominant player in the pascal world, and they're now a huge part of the pascal culture
2013-01-23 22:05:50	Z_Mass	Interesting.. Was there any real reason for making it case insensitive?
2013-01-23 22:05:57	tangentstorm	so... i suppose i will probably have to accept them when i write pascal instead of being a holdout and wanting to do things my way
2013-01-23 22:06:00	tangentstorm	sure
2013-01-23 22:06:30	tangentstorm	first, do you know that guy  z_mass? he's such an idiot and he smells funny.
2013-01-23 22:06:35	tangentstorm	Z_Mass is cool.
2013-01-23 22:06:39	tangentstorm	but z_mass. what a slimeball.
2013-01-23 22:07:26	tangentstorm	it's hard to make a distinction between upper and lower case letters when we read... especially out loud.
2013-01-23 22:07:30	Z_Mass	heh. It seems weechat is also case insensitive :)
2013-01-23 22:07:36	tangentstorm	haha :)
2013-01-23 22:08:05	tangentstorm	there is also a more important, practical reason
2013-01-23 22:08:09	tangentstorm	pascal is old.
2013-01-23 22:08:19	tangentstorm	really old.
2013-01-23 22:08:23	Z_Mass	lol
2013-01-23 22:08:35	tangentstorm	and once upon a time bits were expensive.
2013-01-23 22:09:04	tangentstorm	until the ascii standard came along, it was not uncommon to have machine with 6 or 7 bits in a byte.
2013-01-23 22:09:30	tangentstorm	that's why they use the word "octet". a byte is a small bundle of bits in whatever size the computer you're using provides.
2013-01-23 22:09:53	tangentstorm	that size is 8 on almost all modern machines, but that wasn't always the case
2013-01-23 22:10:06	Z_Mass	Hunh. I thought it was 8 by definition
2013-01-23 22:10:21	Z_Mass	Learn something everyday lol
2013-01-23 22:10:22	tangentstorm	also "word" means the size of the computer's register... so a word on a 64-bit machine should be 64 bits.
2013-01-23 22:10:55	tangentstorm	but it became such a part of the C world and now it's weird to think of a word as being anything but 16 bits.
2013-01-23 22:11:07	tangentstorm	on a 286 it makes perfect sense :)
2013-01-23 22:11:42	tangentstorm	in pascal the same thing happened with "integer" and "cardinal"...
2013-01-23 22:12:40	tangentstorm	same thing kind of happened with "char"... it's 8 bits in most languages... but most applications these days really want a 16 or 32 bit character to support unicode.
2013-01-23 22:13:14	tangentstorm	i'm rambling.
2013-01-23 22:13:43	Z_Mass	lol no worries :D
2013-01-23 22:14:04	tangentstorm	to make a long story short: with 6 bits, you can't afford capital letters... when pascal and lisp and forth and basic came out, you couldn't count on your machine having lower case letters, and so these languages are all case insensitive.
2013-01-23 22:14:37	tangentstorm	( or you can have capitals but now lowercase of course.. that was probably more common )
2013-01-23 22:14:45	tangentstorm	s/now/no/
2013-01-23 22:14:46	tamper	tangentstorm actually meant: ( or you can have capitals but no lowercase of course.. that was probably more common )
2013-01-23 22:15:00	Z_Mass	makes sense
2013-01-23 22:15:35	Z_Mass	It's crazy how far computers have come
2013-01-23 22:16:35	tangentstorm	have you ever heard of the writer, george bernard shaw?
2013-01-23 22:16:49	Z_Mass	Reminds me of that Bill Gates quote saying we will never need more than 64K (or something really small) RAM
2013-01-23 22:16:57	tangentstorm	yeah :)
2013-01-23 22:17:04	Z_Mass	Sounds familiar
2013-01-23 22:17:12	SirSkidmore	Z_Mass: that's actually not a real quote, I don't think
2013-01-23 22:17:28	Z_Mass	Paraphrase?
2013-01-23 22:17:45	tangentstorm	gates has denied ever saying it
2013-01-23 22:17:50	SirSkidmore	^^
2013-01-23 22:17:56	Z_Mass	heh, I would too :D
2013-01-23 22:18:46	tangentstorm	i remember in 8th grade when we were working on TRS-80's with 5.25" floppy disks, and my teacher was telling us about hard drives
2013-01-23 22:19:01	tangentstorm	she was saying you could work for years and years and years and never fill up a hard drive :)
2013-01-23 22:20:04	tangentstorm	my first hard drive was 40mb, on my 386.. i think maybe i had 2mb or ram or something. not sure.
2013-01-23 22:20:26	tangentstorm	i'm not 100% sure my computer even came with a mouse.
2013-01-23 22:20:35	tangentstorm	i think maybe i bought it separately later.
2013-01-23 22:20:58	@intothev01d	well we think its far now looking at that. imagine where it will be with the same time distance in the future
2013-01-23 22:21:01	Z_Mass	That's crazy.. By the time I knew how to do more than play snake I'm sure we had at least a couple gigs
2013-01-23 22:24:35	chance	we started with something like a windows 95 emachines i think?
2013-01-23 22:25:10	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: How would I work in a deltatime into the equation posX += velX * dirX ?
2013-01-23 22:26:00	tangentstorm	oberon (the operating system i want to bring into lpmc) is well under a megabyte.
2013-01-23 22:26:55	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: velocity is dPos / t , right?
2013-01-23 22:27:25	tangentstorm	velocity means the amount by which the object changes its position per unit of time.
2013-01-23 22:27:51	tangentstorm	in this case you would probably make t = 1 second
2013-01-23 22:28:26	Z_Mass	Well I don't have any code yet, I
2013-01-23 22:28:39	Z_Mass	I'm just thinking about how to remove that RK4 physics stuff from my sdl code
2013-01-23 22:28:55	tangentstorm	and dt would be a float (which of course is called double for the same naming reasons that word is 16 bits and whatnot ) that represents a fraction of a second
2013-01-23 22:28:58	Z_Mass	But when I did pong in Allegro, I just set velocity to a number by trial and error
2013-01-23 22:29:17	tangentstorm	i'm not talking about code, i'm talking about physics and math :)
2013-01-23 22:29:20	Z_Mass	Right
2013-01-23 22:29:25	tangentstorm	velocity is change in position over time
2013-01-23 22:29:27	Z_Mass	I don't know much about physics
2013-01-23 22:29:54	Z_Mass	k
2013-01-23 22:29:55	tangentstorm	the d means delta, which is is used in calculus to mean change
2013-01-23 22:30:15	tangentstorm	calculus is the math of physics
2013-01-23 22:30:16	Z_Mass	Would delta time generally be the time since last frame?
2013-01-23 22:30:28	tangentstorm	yes that's what it means
2013-01-23 22:30:30	Z_Mass	k
2013-01-23 22:31:05	tangentstorm	you take the timestamp a float/double/whatever , representing milliseconds since the epoch
2013-01-23 22:31:18	tangentstorm	epoch = january 1 1970
2013-01-23 22:31:20	tangentstorm	and it might be an int
2013-01-23 22:31:46	tangentstorm	so you have the timestamp from the last frame...
2013-01-23 22:31:47	tangentstorm	you do all your calculations
2013-01-23 22:31:56	tangentstorm	you take the timestamp again.
2013-01-23 22:32:09	tangentstorm	now you have calculated the change in time
2013-01-23 22:32:23	SirSkidmore	http://harthur.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/771/
2013-01-23 22:32:23	tamper	SirSkidmore's shortened url is http://bit.ly/Wh0Irg
2013-01-23 22:32:25	SirSkidmore	wand with that
2013-01-23 22:32:29	SirSkidmore	I need some sleep
2013-01-23 22:32:46	tangentstorm	if it's an unsigned integer number representing milliseconds, you want to convert it to a floating point number
2013-01-23 22:33:00	Z_Mass	My main loop looks something like the last example in http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/
2013-01-23 22:33:06	tamper	Z_Mass's shortened url is http://bit.ly/UKsN9r
2013-01-23 22:33:16	tangentstorm	so you say dt = ( last_timestamp - this_timestamp ) / 1000.0
2013-01-23 22:33:16	--	SirSkidmore is now known as SirSkids|Zzz
2013-01-23 22:33:36	tangentstorm	now you have an elapsed time in seconds
2013-01-23 22:33:45	tangentstorm	instead of milliseconds
2013-01-23 22:33:47	tangentstorm	so.
2013-01-23 22:34:16	tangentstorm	SirSkids|Zzz: has left us on a train travelling 100 pixels / second
2013-01-23 22:34:23	tangentstorm	that is his velocity.
2013-01-23 22:34:57	tangentstorm	it has taken   dt = 235.27377 seconds or whatever to explain all this
2013-01-23 22:35:47	tangentstorm	so assuming he hasn't changed course, he must now be    100 px / second * 235.27337  seconds
2013-01-23 22:35:49	tangentstorm	away
2013-01-23 22:36:14	tangentstorm	the "seconds" unit on the right side of the * cancels out the  / second on the left
2013-01-23 22:36:52	tangentstorm	so is change in position: dx = 23,527.337 pixels
2013-01-23 22:36:56	tangentstorm	his
2013-01-23 22:37:51	Z_Mass	Gotcha. So my original "posX += velX * dirX" would become "posX += velX * dt * dirX" ?
2013-01-23 22:37:59	Z_Mass	dirX being either pos or neg 1
2013-01-23 22:38:03	tangentstorm	yes
2013-01-23 22:38:22	tangentstorm	except in physics, velocity would already be signed :)
2013-01-23 22:38:46	tangentstorm	but
2013-01-23 22:38:50	Z_Mass	Right, it's just easier when you have to increment it to have it be the absolute value
2013-01-23 22:39:10	Z_Mass	It took me a while to remember that today working with the stupid code our teacher gave us lol
2013-01-23 22:39:14	tangentstorm	hmm
2013-01-23 22:39:17	tangentstorm	i disagree with this
2013-01-23 22:39:40	tangentstorm	let me show you why... one sec.
2013-01-23 22:39:45	Z_Mass	lol :) k
2013-01-23 22:39:45	tangentstorm	actually i don't disagree that it might be easier
2013-01-23 22:39:56	tangentstorm	it might very well be easier
2013-01-23 22:39:59	tangentstorm	but still i wouldn't do it ;)

2013-01-23 22:41:19	tangentstorm	i do use abs() there to cap the maximum speed
2013-01-23 22:41:41	tangentstorm	but on line 99 and 100 there, i'm modelling gravity and air resistance ( friction )
2013-01-23 22:42:56	tangentstorm	these both affect the character whether he's moving in a positive or negative direction
2013-01-23 22:43:06	tangentstorm	with friction, an absolute value would be fine
2013-01-23 22:43:17	Z_Mass	What does sign() do?
2013-01-23 22:43:19	tangentstorm	because friction works on the speed regardless of direction
2013-01-23 22:44:17	tangentstorm	function sign( x : real ) : cardinal ; begin result := floor( abs( x ) / x ) end;
2013-01-23 22:44:36	tangentstorm	sign( -1.3434) = -1;
2013-01-23 22:44:40	tangentstorm	sign( 0.0 ) = 0;
2013-01-23 22:44:51	tangentstorm	sign( 234234234.34343 ) = 1;
2013-01-23 22:44:57	tangentstorm	or
2013-01-23 22:45:05	Z_Mass	Ah, the examples make that much clearer lol
2013-01-23 22:45:36	tangentstorm	function sign( x : real ): cardinal; begin if x > 0 then result := 1 else if x <0 then result := -1 else result := 0 end;
2013-01-23 22:46:15	tangentstorm	anyway the point is.. gravity can't operate on a speed, only on a velocity ( speed in a particular direction )
2013-01-23 22:47:28	Z_Mass	So do you think I can use some form of that game loop with the accumulator with a basic euler integration pox += velX * dt ?
2013-01-23 22:47:37	tangentstorm	so a) if it's an absolute value it should be called speed instead of velocity to not confuse people who studied physics, and b) you'll probably want to use velocities rather than speeds most of the time anyway.
2013-01-23 22:47:58	tangentstorm	yes
2013-01-23 22:48:07	tangentstorm	that's exactly it
2013-01-23 22:48:23	tangentstorm	if you want to measure speed in seconds, that's all you need
2013-01-23 22:48:33	Z_Mass	Ok, give me 15 min, and I'll let you know how it goes :D
2013-01-23 22:48:33	tangentstorm	pixels per second i mean
2013-01-23 22:49:57	tangentstorm	i actually can't explain what i'm doing with the:  * dt / maxfps   at the moment.
2013-01-23 22:50:37	tangentstorm	i know i'm limiting the frame rate artificially to keep the fan from turning on
2013-01-23 22:52:09	tangentstorm	i suspect i was fiddling with the numbers just to get a good feel rather than thinking about it logically / algebraically.

2013-01-23 23:36:30	Z_Mass	Oh right, this code is using a fixed delta time.. that's probably why

2013-01-23 23:47:31	tangentstorm	oh well :/
2013-01-23 23:49:12	tangentstorm	chance: tell and logging are my wishlist items for tamper. if i code them, would you run them?
2013-01-23 23:49:41	chance	yeah.
2013-01-23 23:49:58	chance	one sec
2013-01-23 23:49:58	tangentstorm	where is tamper running, anyway?
2013-01-23 23:50:08	chance	let me make sure seen is on master for the lpmc repo
2013-01-23 23:51:00	chance	you should be fine to branch off master for the learnprogramming repo
2013-01-23 23:52:01	tangentstorm	thanks. is it python and twisted?
2013-01-23 23:52:28	 *	tangentstorm stops being lazy and looks :)
2013-01-23 23:52:56	chance	yeah.
2013-01-23 23:53:27	tangentstorm	tamper = lpmc/hamper?
2013-01-23 23:53:32	tangentstorm	learnprogramming/hamper i mean
2013-01-23 23:53:39	chance	someones current re-writing the plugin interfaces to use twisted.plugins rather than bravo/exocet
2013-01-23 23:53:48	chance	tangentstorm: yeah
2013-01-23 23:53:50	chance	hosted on my linode
2013-01-23 23:54:43	tangentstorm	are you still using that free hosting company you pointed out a while back too?
2013-01-23 23:56:38	tangentstorm	hmmm. i can swing $19.95/m for an extra server. can maybe even move one of my dns servers onto this
2013-01-24 00:02:12	chance	tangentstorm: i didnt use them ever
2013-01-24 00:02:18	chance	i just use linode
2013-01-24 00:02:21	chance	aws is good too
2013-01-24 00:06:38	tangentstorm	i'm payng $79/m for my smallest server. i was doing cvs hosting on it once upon a time, but now it's just a dns server
2013-01-24 00:06:55	tangentstorm	and a backup machine i think... i rsync to it periodically.
2013-01-24 00:07:08	tangentstorm	that's a waste of money though..
2013-01-24 00:20:24	Z_Mass	wow.. major facepalm
2013-01-24 00:21:07	Z_Mass	I just spent 10 minutes putting cout's everywhere. Problem was I was setting old_time = new_time before calculating dt
2013-01-24 00:22:59	Z_Mass	Wait.. no it's still not reacting to different velocities. But it is smooth now, and dt doesn't == 0
2013-01-24 00:23:09	Z_Mass	damn physics
2013-01-24 00:24:52	Z_Mass	If my dt is always == to 0.001, could it be I need a better timer?
2013-01-24 00:29:36	tangentstorm	yes that's very fishy.
2013-01-24 00:29:56	Z_Mass	I'm using SDL_GetTicks() currently
2013-01-24 00:29:56	tangentstorm	it could be a casting issue.. somehow you're getting 1 before you divide by 1000
2013-01-24 00:30:10	tangentstorm	does that return a value in milliseconds?
2013-01-24 00:30:23	tangentstorm	i suspect it returns the number 1 :)
2013-01-24 00:30:39	Z_Mass	Ya I believe it's in ms
2013-01-24 00:30:52	Z_Mass	ahh. Uint32 
2013-01-24 00:31:14	Z_Mass	Stupid sdl.. It's like they don't know what a floating point number is
2013-01-24 00:31:31	Z_Mass	All the blitting/drawing stuff only takes int's as well
2013-01-24 00:32:18	tangentstorm	perhaps because it's dealing with pixels
2013-01-24 00:33:26	Z_Mass	I guess that makes sense. It's a pain though when your position is a double
2013-01-24 00:33:49	tangentstorm	hmm
2013-01-24 00:34:22	tangentstorm	well first you might have better luck with the opengl side of sdl.
2013-01-24 00:35:40	Z_Mass	Is it harder to work with?
2013-01-24 00:35:48	tangentstorm	second... i don't know what you're working on, but is there scrolling involved?
2013-01-24 00:36:24	Z_Mass	I'm just bouncing a sprite around right now, trying to build a "game engine" of sorts to handle boilerplate for this semester
2013-01-24 00:36:48	tangentstorm	opengl? i don't know. i've only played with it for a little bit. my sdl experience is mostly with pygame and the pascal version, both of which handle the conversions for me
2013-01-24 00:36:51	Z_Mass	I'm not having much luck with sdl currently. I did learn and write 2 template classes though :)
2013-01-24 00:37:29	tangentstorm	if you weren't stuck with c i'd try to sell you on ZenGL + pascal :)
2013-01-24 00:37:30	Z_Mass	Ya, I wish we could just use something like SFML2 since we're supposed to be learning c++. 
2013-01-24 00:37:48	tangentstorm	but
2013-01-24 00:37:57	Z_Mass	Heh, pascal looks funky to me, I'd have to sit down for a while and try it though
2013-01-24 00:38:15	tangentstorm	what i was going to say about scrolling is that if you're scrolling then your coordinates shouldn't be in pixels anyway.
2013-01-24 00:38:57	tangentstorm	it shouldn't matter that the game world is in real numbers and the bitmaps are in pixel numbers because you should have two sets of coordinates
2013-01-24 00:39:38	tangentstorm	camera coordinates for showing sprites on the screen and world coordinates for modelling your objects
2013-01-24 00:39:42	Z_Mass	Hmm.. so maybe my GameObject.get_position() should return a second set of coords that are converted to ints?
2013-01-24 00:39:51	tangentstorm	all your physics stuff and game logic works on the real numbers, and then the camera draws them in pixels
2013-01-24 00:40:05	tangentstorm	no
2013-01-24 00:40:48	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: look on github for user adamatomic .. he has a repository with a one-page rendering engine in flash
2013-01-24 00:40:54	Z_Mass	k
2013-01-24 00:41:09	tangentstorm	he is the author of the game cannabalt and the flixel game programming library
2013-01-24 00:41:18	tangentstorm	very smart dude
2013-01-24 00:45:27	Z_Mass	heh, I think I need to call it a night on this
2013-01-24 00:46:14	Z_Mass	thanks for the link though, it looks comparable to c/c++ style syntax
2013-01-24 00:47:21	tangentstorm	yeah
2013-01-24 00:47:25	tangentstorm	have a good night
2013-01-24 00:47:38	Z_Mass	you too, later

2013-02-02 02:52:52	tangentstorm	well, i crashed and slept all day after not shipping my forth game.
2013-02-02 02:53:22	tangentstorm	the last couple hours before the deadline i couldn't even think straight.
2013-02-02 02:54:12	Expez	You put in an impressive amount of time, though
2013-02-02 02:54:32	tangentstorm	i'm going to have to rewrite one of the modules in retro
2013-02-02 02:54:34	Expez	Just start a little earlier this month :P
2013-02-02 02:55:08	tangentstorm	yeah :) i'm just tired of missing deadlines on these little 48-hour things. i want to get better at that.
2013-02-02 02:55:22	tangentstorm	but that doesn't mean i should treat a month-long project as a 48-hour one! :)
2013-02-02 02:56:02	tangentstorm	anyway. i've got ruby and rspec and cucumber and various curses things all set up.
2013-02-02 02:56:32	Expez	What does cucumber offer that rspec does not?
2013-02-02 02:56:37	tangentstorm	it isn't ruby.
2013-02-02 02:56:58	tangentstorm	it decouples the language used in the tests from the language used in the implementation.
2013-02-02 02:57:22	tangentstorm	the language is actually called gherkin i guess
2013-02-02 02:58:12	tangentstorm	https://gist.github.com/1190561
2013-02-02 02:58:22	tangentstorm	^ gherkin test runner in python
2013-02-02 02:58:22	Expez	How useful is that?  Won't you have to use your application language quite a bit in the tests anyway?  E.g to prepare your object state for the tests?

2013-02-03 22:58:04	SirSkidmore	rocking the emacs ;)
2013-02-03 22:59:20	SirSkidmore	so, if I want to modify Bootstrap, how does that pertain to the Apache license? It's a derivitive so I know I have to "state changes," "include copyright notice," and "include the license" but I'm not sure what all that means.
2013-02-03 22:59:34	SirSkidmore	do I have to include the copy of bootstrap that I'm modifying?
2013-02-03 22:59:46	SirSkidmore	I'm not good at this whole legal thing
2013-02-03 23:00:15	chance	you dont have to do anything
2013-02-03 23:01:11	SirSkidmore	So under what pretense would I have to do something?
2013-02-03 23:01:29	chance	if you gave it to someone else
2013-02-03 23:01:37	chance	you would have to give them the license that came with it
2013-02-03 23:02:09	chance	any contributions to the project will have to adhere to the apache license
2013-02-03 23:02:25	SirSkidmore	the Apache license. So if I were to push it to Github, I would just have to inclue the license with it?
2013-02-03 23:02:26	chance	http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

2013-02-03 23:03:31	chance	i think the license is in the code

2013-02-03 23:04:18	SirSkidmore	Okay
2013-02-03 23:04:24	SirSkidmore	this legal stuff is silly.
2013-02-03 23:04:33	SirSkidmore	I like the DWTFYW license or whatever
2013-02-03 23:04:35	SirSkidmore	I get hta
2013-02-03 23:04:41	SirSkidmore	s/hta/that/
2013-02-03 23:04:41	tamper	SirSkidmore actually meant: I get that
2013-02-03 23:05:58	SirSkidmore	Oh
2013-02-03 23:06:02	SirSkidmore	Okay, that makes sense
2013-02-03 23:06:31	SirSkidmore	Actually, reading the license made more sense than trying to figure out the cryptic tl;dr legal stuff
2013-02-03 23:06:44	jfredett	hehe
2013-02-03 23:07:48	jfredett	Most OSS licenses fall into the following two categories -- "You must cite me" or "You must cite and return changes" -- GPL, Apache, etc are "cite-and-return", BSD, MIT, etc are 'Cite only'
2013-02-03 23:08:09	jfredett	all include some kind of disclaimer of warrenty or efficacy (eg, you can't sue me if your shit breaks)
2013-02-03 23:08:30	SirSkidmore	At won't point would I have to "You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files"? like do I include a comment /* I CHANGED THIS */ ?
2013-02-03 23:08:36	jfredett	that's just sort of a strong form of indemnification (ie, use implies you indemnify me)
2013-02-03 23:09:21	jfredett	SirSkidmore: The other important thing to realize is that all of these things are open to interpretation by the copyright holder -- typically people accept VCS histories as 'notice of change'
2013-02-03 23:09:30	jfredett	eg, a git commit + a diff, or a patchfile, etc.
2013-02-03 23:09:37	SirSkidmore	Ah
2013-02-03 23:09:39	SirSkidmore	neat
2013-02-03 23:09:41	jfredett	remember that intent is 9/10ths of the law.
2013-02-03 23:10:00	jfredett	so long as everyone intends to comply, you're probably not going to get in much trouble.
2013-02-03 23:10:01	SirSkidmore	okay, "cite-and-return" how do I "return" my modifications to bootstrap?
2013-02-03 23:10:20	jfredett	are you publishing them for others to use in download?
2013-02-03 23:10:28	jfredett	or are they just for your own use?
2013-02-03 23:10:43	jfredett	(ie, are you fixing a bug/adding a feature?)
2013-02-03 23:10:54	jfredett	or just modifying for your one use case?
2013-02-03 23:11:35	SirSkidmore	Well, I mean for right now, just my site
2013-02-03 23:11:56	SirSkidmore	I might want to push it up to GitHub depening on how much I change though
2013-02-03 23:12:44	jfredett	SirSkidmore: is the change generic?
2013-02-03 23:13:22	jfredett	what I'm trying to assess is whether you modified bootstrap in a way that could be considered a 'derivative work' as opposed to just a 'fair use'
2013-02-03 23:13:35	jfredett	the distinction is like this- say I make a library like rspec.
2013-02-03 23:13:46	jfredett	rspec is used in dozens of projects
2013-02-03 23:14:11	jfredett	and in using rspec, I modify some code in rspec by metaprogramming something or even editing the source
2013-02-03 23:14:25	jfredett	but the intent of the change is just to make something work for me, and it's not my intent to distribute it
2013-02-03 23:14:45	jfredett	eg, I don't want to say, "hey, here's my cool fix for rspec, you should use my version now"
2013-02-03 23:14:55	SirSkidmore	OHH
2013-02-03 23:15:00	jfredett	in that case, it's just a change for me
2013-02-03 23:15:14	jfredett	it's my _use_ of rspec, and my program is merely _consuming_ it
2013-02-03 23:15:22	jfredett	compare to me going into rspec to add a feature I need
2013-02-03 23:15:22	SirSkidmore	So if I added something sweet, like a new feature or a radical change, my contribution back would be a pull request
2013-02-03 23:15:29	jfredett	Precisely
2013-02-03 23:15:43	jfredett	technically, both are 'derivative works'
2013-02-03 23:15:51	jfredett	but because the former is useless to everyone but me
2013-02-03 23:15:56	SirSkidmore	but if I'm just modifying colors and grid stuff and  the like, I don't need to offer a pull request
2013-02-03 23:16:01	jfredett	there is no sense bothering to try
2013-02-03 23:16:09	SirSkidmore	Cool
2013-02-03 23:16:10	jfredett	exactly
2013-02-03 23:16:17	SirSkidmore	thhanks a bunch jfredett :)
2013-02-03 23:16:20	SirSkidmore	But I need some sleep now
2013-02-03 23:16:22	SirSkidmore	Good night!
2013-02-03 23:16:27	jfredett	a good rule of thumb -- if you could do it by metaprogramming/layering another stylesheet
2013-02-03 23:16:27	--	SirSkidmore is now known as SirSkids|Zzz
2013-02-03 23:16:34	SirSkids|Zzz	do that?
2013-02-03 23:16:39	jfredett	it's probably not a derivative work worth re-contributing
2013-02-03 23:16:39	chance	SirSkids|Zzz: also
2013-02-03 23:16:41	jfredett	(and yes)
2013-02-03 23:16:47	chance	you have to keep in mind
2013-02-03 23:16:50	jfredett	(mostly)
2013-02-03 23:16:53	chance	you can use bootstrap
2013-02-03 23:16:58	chance	and then another seperate CSS file
2013-02-03 23:17:05	jfredett	^-- this.
2013-02-03 23:17:17	SirSkids|Zzz	Okay
2013-02-03 23:17:19	jfredett	the 'C' in CSS stands for 'cascading'
2013-02-03 23:17:21	chance	you shouldnt be changing much of anything, you just overwrite their stuff, and use their grids/classes "as-is"
2013-02-03 23:17:26	jfredett	as in, apply one after the other
2013-02-03 23:17:27	jfredett	:)

2013-02-03 23:17:56	SirSkids|Zzz	Is what I was looking at and I'm really liking the Amelai red/blue theme, but I hate the non-rounded buttons
2013-02-03 23:18:06	SirSkids|Zzz	I should just add a second css file to change it?
2013-02-03 23:18:16	jfredett	SirSkids|Zzz: thats how I'd do it
2013-02-03 23:18:55	chance	my space bar seemskinda dead..
2013-02-03 23:19:50	SirSkids|Zzz	Cool
2013-02-03 23:19:53	SirSkids|Zzz	thanks guys :)
2013-02-03 23:20:00	SirSkids|Zzz	you always know what to do :P
2013-02-03 23:20:58	jfredett	that's the idea. :)
2013-02-03 23:21:35	SirSkids|Zzz	I'm just looking forward to the day I can give back :)
2013-02-03 23:21:51	jfredett	it'll happen, man. Just keep learning.
2013-02-03 23:23:30	SirSkids|Zzz	Well, I really need some sleep for tomorrow
2013-02-03 23:23:35	SirSkids|Zzz	I have to be at work early

2013-02-07 18:28:30	Jazztoken	ok Java related problem that I can't seem to find answers for, which leads me to believe I'm approaching the problem wrong.
2013-02-07 18:29:51	Jazztoken	I have some text files that are loaded at runtime to help build the the world in my project. I want them to be copy and pastable outside of a .jar rather than built into the game.
2013-02-07 18:30:51	Jazztoken	The answer I'm seeing seems to be "load them as a resource", but that doesn't seem to make any sense. The organization of the files matters, and having a list of them is important.

2013-02-07 19:19:14	tangentstorm	Expez: haven't actually tried to run the rb_termbox code yet. probably the rake dependency can just be removed.
2013-02-07 19:20:31	tangentstorm	Jazztoken: does the user create and modify those text files?
2013-02-07 19:21:21	tangentstorm	maybe just have a default value in the jar as a resource, and when the program runs, generate it, just like generating a default config file.
2013-02-07 19:25:43	Jazztoken	@tangentstorm: I think I've managed to hack something together, still trying to get it to work though
2013-02-07 19:26:11	jfredett	SirSkidmore: lpmc.org wouldn't be bad, but it's really not necessary. :)
2013-02-07 19:26:29	SirSkidmore	It's taken
2013-02-07 19:27:02	jfredett	since we're not a 501c organization, we can't accept donations, technically.
2013-02-07 19:27:21	jfredett	so the 'of sorts' bit is important. :)
2013-02-07 19:27:51	SirSkidmore	Okay, well, you know what I mean
2013-02-07 19:27:51	SirSkidmore	heh
2013-02-07 19:27:52	jfredett	domai.nr, iirc, is a nifty site for punning domain names
2013-02-07 19:28:00	jfredett	i wonder if there is a lp.mc
2013-02-07 19:28:05	SirSkidmore	no
2013-02-07 19:28:09	SirSkidmore	I looked anyway
2013-02-07 19:28:12	jfredett	that would be neat as shit (and probably cost millions)
2013-02-07 19:28:35	SirSkidmore	A friend of mine paid nearly a thousand for ray.vc
2013-02-07 19:29:01	SirSkidmore	there is an .mc
2013-02-07 19:29:11	SirSkidmore	but I kind find a registrar with it
2013-02-07 19:32:51	@intothev01d	ive come across a few but it looks like .mc isnt' cheap (at least 50 or more)
2013-02-07 19:33:39	@intothev01d	i also think it is restricted to Monaco
2013-02-07 19:41:22	tangentstorm	i ordered osrecruits.org a while back
2013-02-07 19:41:40	tangentstorm	openrecruits.org
2013-02-07 19:42:26	tangentstorm	was thinking of doing something lpmc related with it
2013-02-07 19:42:37	tangentstorm	or along the same lines
2013-02-07 19:49:19	SirSkidmore	I mean, if you don't want a domain yet for lpmc
2013-02-07 19:49:22	SirSkidmore	that's fine
2013-02-07 19:49:28	SirSkidmore	I was just thinking about it last night

2013-02-07 20:05:40	tangentstorm	i don't think the site on github reflects how we actually operate
2013-02-07 20:06:52	tangentstorm	so far we don't really do any of those things.
2013-02-07 20:07:50	tangentstorm	at least, it isn't our normal mode of operation.
2013-02-07 20:08:46	tangentstorm	so far, *as a group*, we haven't really been contributing to open source projects, or helping people get involved in them.

2013-02-08 15:05:56	jfredett	thats why he breaks them, he's thought it all through
2013-02-08 15:05:59	jfredett	it's not just physical pain
2013-02-08 15:06:06	jfredett	it's financial and emotional pain

2013-02-08 22:55:19	SirSkids|Zzz	Yeah, default is super enter, which is mapped to URxvt
2013-02-08 22:55:25	jfredett	ah
2013-02-08 22:55:29	jfredett	I don't have urxvt i bet
2013-02-08 22:55:32	SirSkids|Zzz	so, if you don't use URxvt, it won't do anything
2013-02-08 22:55:35	jfredett	right
2013-02-08 22:55:40	jfredett	that's unfortunate.
2013-02-08 22:55:53	SirSkids|Zzz	just use super ctrl q to quit subtly
2013-02-08 22:56:22	jfredett	also not working.
2013-02-08 22:56:28	SirSkids|Zzz	uh
2013-02-08 22:56:31	jfredett	what's really bad
2013-02-08 22:56:38	jfredett	ctrl-alt-del isn't working either
2013-02-08 22:56:41	SirSkids|Zzz	ctrl alt f1 to go into a tty
2013-02-08 22:56:44	SirSkids|Zzz	pkill x
2013-02-08 22:56:46	jfredett	that makes me very angry.
2013-02-08 22:56:50	SirSkids|Zzz	then configure that shit
2013-02-08 22:56:54	jfredett	phew
2013-02-08 22:57:02	jfredett	they did one thing right, at least
2013-02-08 22:57:16	SirSkids|Zzz	But I really need to get to bed
2013-02-08 22:57:21	jfredett	i have no .subtlerc
2013-02-08 22:57:23	jfredett	that's probably bad

2013-02-09 14:23:04	Z_Mass	What would be a good project to get familiar with databases?
2013-02-09 14:28:23	timgd	Z_Mass: build a library of your mp3's ?
2013-02-09 14:30:12	@intothev01d	Z_Mass, have you worked with sql at all before or just starting out?
2013-02-09 14:31:13	Z_Mass	timgd: Hmm, that could be useful. intothev01d: Well I have a db class this semester, but it's not moving very fast so far
2013-02-09 14:31:57	Z_Mass	So far I've made a table with 3 columns, added and removed and that's about it
2013-02-09 14:32:23	@intothev01d	gotcha
2013-02-09 14:32:25	@intothev01d	why not work ahead then?
2013-02-09 14:32:45	Z_Mass	I would, but these stupid teachers don't let you see future labs
2013-02-09 14:32:56	@intothev01d	i mean just in the book
2013-02-09 14:32:57	Z_Mass	The links only work about a day before the start
2013-02-09 14:33:45	Z_Mass	The book is a php/mysql book, but I'm not sure we're doing any php. I'd rather just use a language I know and learn databases on their own
2013-02-09 14:34:31	@intothev01d	i would just practice learning sql mostly, you can use mysql or something for the rdbms
2013-02-09 14:35:06	@intothev01d	then just figure out how to link tables, foreign keys, select statements, nested queries, normalization
2013-02-09 14:35:26	@intothev01d	maybe try and find an online tutorial about it… let me look myself
2013-02-09 14:35:43	@intothev01d	oh i know. standford was offering a course this semester on databases
2013-02-09 14:36:03	@intothev01d	http://class2go.stanford.edu/db/Winter2013

2013-02-09 14:36:17	Z_Mass	Our teacher gave us a tutorial link, sqlcourse I think. It was pretty dry though. I'll check that out. Thanks :)
2013-02-09 14:36:26	@intothev01d	they will prob teach more than what you'll learn ( I know they cover a lot more that what I went over in my class on it)
2013-02-09 14:37:39	Z_Mass	Do you know if the course material is available after the course is over?
2013-02-09 14:38:00	@intothev01d	not sure
2013-02-09 14:39:04	Z_Mass	Hmm, registering now, not much is available until you do.
2013-02-09 14:42:13	tangentstorm	a good project to learn databases? you could help me build the database engine for minneron... :)
2013-02-09 14:43:00	Z_Mass	Heh, I think I'd need to be familiar with them before making a db engine :P

2013-02-09 15:05:20	Expez	Still, what a rush when half the board was opened up when I opened that critical cell!
2013-02-09 15:08:35	tangentstorm	ah
2013-02-09 15:08:44	tangentstorm	( is  the word that starts a comment
2013-02-09 15:08:45	tangentstorm	you just needed to type )
2013-02-09 15:09:04	Expez	should def add that to the readme
2013-02-09 15:09:04	tangentstorm	thanks for trying it out :)
2013-02-09 15:09:20	Expez	Have you started on the game for this month?
2013-02-09 15:09:36	tangentstorm	what's interesting is when you hit 'q' and can start digging around inside retro... :)
2013-02-09 15:09:44	tangentstorm	nope
2013-02-09 15:10:20	tangentstorm	i really don't want to wait until the last minute again though. i need to make something small.
2013-02-09 15:10:54	tangentstorm	there's a game called flood-it for android which is pretty trivial to implement given the flood fill algorithm i already implemented
2013-02-09 15:11:24	tangentstorm	basically it's just a bunch of randomly colored squares, and you tap different colors to do a flood fill in the upper left corner
2013-02-09 15:11:45	tangentstorm	the objective is to clear the entire board in a specific number of moves
2013-02-09 15:13:21	tangentstorm	it's one of those pointless games that is nonetheless rather fun... or at least something to look at while i'm thinking about other stuff...
2013-02-09 15:14:03	Expez	aight
2013-02-09 15:14:22	tangentstorm	anyway, i thought i might just make that one while i work on the canvas and mouse support and putting this thing in a browser.
2013-02-09 15:15:05	tangentstorm	i have a whole stack of original games i want to make but it's a matter of time management :)
2013-02-09 15:15:39	tangentstorm	today i am focusing on getting this running in a browser again.
2013-02-09 15:16:19	tangentstorm	I have a test suite for ngaro (the vm) written in python, and intothev01d was cool enough to bring the js version under test with node.js
2013-02-09 15:16:35	tangentstorm	but the game fails in the browser and i don't know why.
2013-02-09 15:17:38	tangentstorm	so today, i'm hooking up javascript in the browser directly to python over a websocket.
2013-02-09 15:19:19	tangentstorm	hopefully also extract the tests from python and put them into gherkin (cucumber) instead.

2013-02-09 15:38:45	Expez	why not termbox?
2013-02-09 15:38:52	tangentstorm	i can't compile it!
2013-02-09 15:38:59	Expez	oh
2013-02-09 15:39:13	tangentstorm	it might be small enough to just port it to ruby though.
2013-02-09 15:39:17	Expez	that thing was in AUR, so I just installed it heh
2013-02-09 15:39:42	tangentstorm	maybe i'll try again.
2013-02-09 15:41:17	tangentstorm	Expez: for next month's game, i'm kind of thinking of doing something with this: https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Mako/tree/master/games
2013-02-09 15:41:18	tamper	tangentstorm's shortened url is http://bit.ly/Z27NPG
2013-02-09 15:41:44	tangentstorm	if you have java and ant handy, he's got a bunch of cool little SNES-style games written in forth on his vm.
2013-02-09 15:42:34	tangentstorm	i want to add some sprite and sound devices to ngaro and get his code running on it in the browser.
2013-02-09 15:42:48	Expez	that would be cool
2013-02-09 15:42:55	tangentstorm	he's got a pretty awesome one called forth warrior (warrior 2) that's sort of a top-down zelda-like
2013-02-09 15:43:21	tangentstorm	but instead of controlling the game with a controller, you write a forth program saying what moves the hero should make
2013-02-09 15:43:57	tangentstorm	i think that's brilliant.
2013-02-09 15:44:14	tangentstorm	anyway... back to work :)

2013-02-09 18:40:29	Enalicho	Better to move them out into a seperate module so that you can reuse them since they're pretty general

2013-02-11 17:20:31	tangentstorm	i'm still struggling with ngaro.js :/
2013-02-11 17:20:51	@intothev01d	whats going on with it?
2013-02-11 17:21:24	tangentstorm	it's broken completely in firefox and i don't know why.
2013-02-11 17:21:53	tangentstorm	it works fine in chrome, broken in firefox
2013-02-11 17:22:03	@intothev01d	what version?
2013-02-11 17:22:11	tangentstorm	i spent *hours* yesterday getting the test suite to run inside firefox
2013-02-11 17:22:11	@intothev01d	of firefox
2013-02-11 17:22:44	tangentstorm	18.0 on ubuntu, and also aurora on windows 7
2013-02-11 17:23:23	@intothev01d	do you have it hosted? i can check it in firefox for mac, I'm running 18 as well
2013-02-11 17:24:05	@intothev01d	18.0.2 to be exact
2013-02-11 17:24:41	tangentstorm	http://games.tangentcode.com/retro/src/console.html

2013-02-11 17:24:43	tangentstorm	same mhpage we looked at the other day
2013-02-11 17:25:03	tangentstorm	that's actually not the latest and greatest version, but it's definitely broken
2013-02-11 17:25:32	@intothev01d	that it is
2013-02-11 17:25:33	tangentstorm	you have to wait for it to load still because the image is 4mb :/
2013-02-11 17:25:47	@intothev01d	whats like a test input i can give it?
2013-02-11 17:26:02	tangentstorm	i can open that page in chromium, type "words" and it'll show the dictionary.
2013-02-11 17:26:21	tangentstorm	in firefox, anything you type just reboots  the vm
2013-02-11 17:26:31	tangentstorm	( causing it to say "Retro 11.5" again )
2013-02-11 17:26:32	@intothev01d	yea
2013-02-11 17:26:39	@intothev01d	how do i add numbers?
2013-02-11 17:26:52	tangentstorm	1 2 + putn
2013-02-11 17:27:32	@intothev01d	so you just have to enter each of those seperately right?
2013-02-11 17:27:32	@intothev01d	i did and it works like you said in chrome
2013-02-11 17:27:42	tangentstorm	it'll say "ok" after each word
2013-02-11 17:27:42	tangentstorm	as you type space
2013-02-11 17:27:52	tangentstorm	it executes each word immediately.
2013-02-11 17:28:11	@intothev01d	yea
2013-02-11 17:28:21	tangentstorm	also in chrome, another bug: 1 2 .s should show the stack has two items
2013-02-11 17:28:22	@intothev01d	thats so weird how it's resetting in firefox
2013-02-11 17:28:35	tangentstorm	but it just says <0>
2013-02-11 17:29:06	tangentstorm	did you see minesweepr?
2013-02-11 17:30:22	@intothev01d	nope
2013-02-11 17:30:50	tangentstorm	ssh retro@argon.sabren.com ... password: oet3jgp
2013-02-11 17:31:29	tangentstorm	my goal is to get this demo to run inside the browser.
2013-02-11 17:32:04	@intothev01d	for minesweeper?
2013-02-11 17:32:12	tangentstorm	oh
2013-02-11 17:32:15	tangentstorm	yeah sorry. i didn't actually explain it :)
2013-02-11 17:32:29	@intothev01d	ah ok. yea you built it for retro right?
2013-02-11 17:32:48	tangentstorm	yeah. minesweepr is basically just an extended "ok" prompt for retro.
2013-02-11 17:33:14	tangentstorm	if you log in there and type "q" you'll exit the game and get a colorized "ok" prompt
2013-02-11 17:33:42	tangentstorm	but at that prompt, you can type "show" and it'll show you the minesweepr board
2013-02-11 17:33:52	@intothev01d	cool
2013-02-11 17:34:03	tangentstorm	so the game is just a bunch of words showing off what retro is, basically.
2013-02-11 17:34:12	@intothev01d	pretty neat though
2013-02-11 17:34:13	@intothev01d	i like it
2013-02-11 17:34:24	tangentstorm	and you can type help to see the little start on a help system i wrote
2013-02-11 17:34:31	tangentstorm	thanks :)
2013-02-11 17:35:17	@intothev01d	did you ever figure out the troubles you were having with Hatter and ncurses the other day?
2013-02-11 17:35:26	tangentstorm	the other point of minesweepr was to build some words up in retro to make it feel a bit more like pascal, for my compiler.
2013-02-11 17:35:57	tangentstorm	i still can't get rbcurse to compile.
2013-02-11 17:36:09	tangentstorm	well, i can't get the thing it depends on to compile.
2013-02-11 17:36:19	tangentstorm	ffi:ncurses
2013-02-11 17:36:19	@intothev01d	ah
2013-02-11 17:36:24	tangentstorm	although one of the other ncurses worked.

2013-02-11 17:38:53	tangentstorm	the real problem is that i just can't see inside of retro.

2013-02-12 20:30:09	@intothev01d	also, is there a list of commands that could be implemented on hamper? think maybe we should start a list either in the issues on the project or to-dos (unless there are some already?)
2013-02-12 20:30:19	chance	memory
2013-02-12 20:46:19	taternuts	I'm gonna have to look into it for a bit, I haven't used irc since the 90's really and don't know python
2013-02-12 20:46:29	chance	let me know if you have any questions
2013-02-12 20:46:49	taternuts	I will, thanks
2013-02-12 20:49:40	taternuts	been working with linq/lambda stuff in c# this week and I'm kind of excited to be able to build something/familiarize myself with python

2013-02-12 21:39:40	tangentstorm	yep
2013-02-12 21:40:13	Z_Mass	k, awesome. I'm doing equation 3. I'll show you a diagram of my circuit prototype. Something is not adding up lol
2013-02-12 21:40:13	tangentstorm	does + mean "or" and the dot mean and?
2013-02-12 21:40:23	Z_Mass	Yep
2013-02-12 21:40:27	tangentstorm	and the line means "not"
2013-02-12 21:40:59	Z_Mass	Yep. And "AC" would be A AND C
2013-02-12 21:41:20	tangentstorm	ok
2013-02-12 21:42:00	taternuts	what are the superscript notations for
2013-02-12 21:42:56	Z_Mass	You mean like the big line above multiple variables?
2013-02-12 21:42:59	taternuts	yeah
2013-02-12 21:43:04	tangentstorm	"not"
2013-02-12 21:43:07	taternuts	k

2013-02-12 21:45:45	Z_Mass	The triangle gates being or's
2013-02-12 21:47:20	tangentstorm	looking..
2013-02-12 21:47:30	taternuts	me too, looks ok from what I know about logic gates
2013-02-12 21:47:40	taternuts	which is what I learned in this irc chat
2013-02-12 21:48:53	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: i'd have to work it out...  why don't you just test it?
2013-02-12 21:49:47	Z_Mass	I've tried, but my physical circuit doesn't act like the simulated one, and the simulated one does not agree with what I got from a truth table generator :D
2013-02-12 21:50:06	Z_Mass	Just figured I'd get a second opinion on the intended circuit and go from there lol
2013-02-12 21:51:50	taternuts	ah ok (just wiki'd logic gates), let me look at it for a second, I might be able to give you a somewhat half decent opinion
2013-02-12 21:52:22	Z_Mass	taternuts: Thanks :)
2013-02-12 21:53:59	taternuts	tbh it looks good
2013-02-12 21:54:05	taternuts	oooh
2013-02-12 21:54:11	taternuts	didn't see the huge line about
2013-02-12 21:54:13	taternuts	*above
2013-02-12 21:54:20	taternuts	what does that mean
2013-02-12 21:54:56	Z_Mass	A&~B&C NOR ~A~C
2013-02-12 21:54:59	taternuts	so it takes the (ABC + AC) set and acts on that I assume
2013-02-12 21:55:27	taternuts	I never took CS, so you'll have to explain the meanings of the characters
2013-02-12 21:55:34	taternuts	what is the '~' operator
2013-02-12 21:55:39	Z_Mass	& = and, ~ = NOT
2013-02-12 21:55:43	taternuts	k
2013-02-12 21:55:51	taternuts	so that's the base equation you need to map?
2013-02-12 21:56:30	taternuts	ahh and andor whatever isn't negated
2013-02-12 21:56:47	tangentstorm	Z_Mass: that diagram does look like it implements the equation
2013-02-12 21:57:08	Z_Mass	taternuts: Ya a NOR would just be the inverse output of an OR
2013-02-12 21:57:41	Z_Mass	tangentstorm: Cool, now to figure out how to get the simulator to actually work properly. 
2013-02-12 21:57:57	taternuts	looks like BC instead of AC for the second iter?
2013-02-12 21:58:26	Z_Mass	I just noticed that the NOR is not outputing HIGH when both inputs are LOW
2013-02-12 21:58:31	 *	taternuts doesn't really know what I'm talking about
2013-02-12 21:58:45	 *	taternuts and hasn't used IRC in a while
2013-02-12 21:58:51	taternuts	haha
2013-02-12 21:59:08	Z_Mass	taternuts: What do you mean the second iter?
2013-02-12 21:59:20	taternuts	the second level
2013-02-12 21:59:29	taternuts	one sec, dont' know the vocab to describe it
2013-02-12 21:59:40	tangentstorm	you mean the diagram?
2013-02-12 21:59:55	taternuts	http://i.imgur.com/XlYIM0S.png
2013-02-12 22:00:00	taternuts	that part
2013-02-12 22:00:16	taternuts	I guess C persists to make AC?
2013-02-12 22:01:09	Z_Mass	The inputs are daisy chained. The middle 3 input AND is A&~B&C and the bottom AND is ~A&~C
2013-02-12 22:02:10	tangentstorm	taternuts: AC means a and c  (and is like "multiply")
2013-02-12 22:02:20	tangentstorm	in fact it is multiply :)
2013-02-12 22:02:44	tangentstorm	0 * 1 = 0, 0 * 0 = 0, 1 * 0 = 0, 1 * 1 = 1
2013-02-12 22:04:01	Z_Mass	I still fail to see how this electronics class relates to game programming though :P
2013-02-12 22:04:41	taternuts	knowing the basics of how it all works helps to reduce the magic
2013-02-12 22:05:14	tangentstorm	i dunno, but it sounds like a fun class :)
2013-02-12 22:05:17	taternuts	when you know how something is going to be implemented on a low level, you can really start to optimize
2013-02-12 22:05:41	taternuts	yeah I fucking hated college, now I wish I could take the classes for fun
2013-02-12 22:05:43	Z_Mass	True, but I doubt I'll be using this low of logic to optimize a game
2013-02-12 22:06:01	taternuts	actually I did take my little brothers advanced web design class for him, and it was pretty fun
2013-02-12 22:06:11	tangentstorm	haha
2013-02-12 22:10:20	Z_Mass	Awesome, turns out my simulator sucks (or I don't know how to use it) but my physical circuit is correct. :D

2013-02-12 22:27:12	Z_Mass	taternuts: Cool, now I've got something to watch during class :D
2013-02-12 22:27:51	taternuts	ecnahc515: sorry I saw you changed names from cache, I meant hamper
2013-02-12 22:28:04	Z_Mass	Heh, speaking of *nix easter eggs, we're watching the social network and at some point he says "I just had to emacs into the system" or something like that
2013-02-12 22:28:15	Z_Mass	I cringed a little lol
2013-02-12 22:28:21	taternuts	man when I first watched the social network I was enthralled
2013-02-12 22:28:29	taternuts	now I'm like...damn...
2013-02-12 22:29:11	taternuts	what a joke
2013-02-12 22:29:32	taternuts	".....I need your algorithm"
2013-02-12 22:29:43	Z_Mass	At least it's fairly long, we only got through half last class
2013-02-12 22:30:11	Z_Mass	It's about as bad as big bang
2013-02-12 22:30:13	taternuts	I'm not a *nix guy, I can move around with it but sadly I'm a windoze kid
2013-02-12 22:30:51	taternuts	I started deving for my dad in AS3 on his MBP and really wish w7 had bash
2013-02-12 22:31:08	Z_Mass	powershell knows ls :P
2013-02-12 22:31:12	taternuts	yeah
2013-02-12 22:31:15	taternuts	...yeah
2013-02-12 22:31:41	taternuts	cygwin is probably better at emulating an actual bash env
2013-02-12 22:31:51	taternuts	but I'm sure powershell can do a lot
2013-02-12 22:32:11	taternuts	I'm a windows guy (in the fact that I've done most of my dev work with C#), but I won't touch powershell
2013-02-12 22:32:32	taternuts	thats for windows sysadmins
2013-02-12 22:32:53	taternuts	and I mean, windows sysadmins? I guess
2013-02-12 22:33:08	Z_Mass	I've never really used it, or the normal command line much
2013-02-12 22:33:43	taternuts	microsoft is really good with languages and with developers, they are really good with their tools and APIs
2013-02-12 22:33:55	taternuts	so I don't doubt powershell is powerful and useful
2013-02-12 22:34:17	Z_Mass	Visual Studio is pretty nice, I played around with XNA a little. Other than that I never boot windows lol
2013-02-12 22:34:51	taternuts	visual studio = widely considered one of the best IDE's out
2013-02-12 22:35:32	Z_Mass	I find it's overkill for C++ though
2013-02-12 22:35:51	taternuts	I've never programmed in C++
2013-02-12 22:35:59	taternuts	let me ask a master C++ guy what he would use
2013-02-12 22:36:27	 *	Z_Mass guesses vim.
2013-02-12 22:36:43	taternuts	(my pops is a fucking wiz, people used to send his company their compilers so they can test against them)
2013-02-12 22:36:44	taternuts	nah
2013-02-12 22:36:51	taternuts	one sec
2013-02-12 22:40:51	taternuts	ok, VS is the choice
2013-02-12 22:41:11	taternuts	he said the one PITA is the managed vs. unmanaged code thing
2013-02-12 22:41:26	Z_Mass	Is he using all the c++ .net stuff?
2013-02-12 22:41:33	Z_Mass	CLR or something like that I think
2013-02-12 22:41:34	taternuts	brb with more info
2013-02-12 22:41:40	taternuts	yeah, brb
2013-02-12 22:41:43	Z_Mass	lol, k
2013-02-12 22:45:10	taternuts	ok
2013-02-12 22:45:21	taternuts	so if you want a pure C++ env, you might want to go with eclipse
2013-02-12 22:45:58	Z_Mass	CDT doesn't support C++11 though
2013-02-12 22:46:01	taternuts	you're going to go through the .net CLR using VS, but it does eventually get compiled to IL very similar to what eclipse would do, just with safechecks
2013-02-12 22:46:31	taternuts	obviously within the vm
2013-02-12 22:47:24	@intothev01d	eclipse …blech
2013-02-12 22:47:41	Z_Mass	I'll stick to vim and codelite when I need doc tooltips. Eclipse is junk
2013-02-12 22:47:51	taternuts	tbh I've mostly coded in VS
2013-02-12 22:49:11	Z_Mass	taternuts: Do you do C# mainly?
2013-02-12 22:50:04	taternuts	yeah
2013-02-12 22:50:31	taternuts	last month I've been using AS3
2013-02-12 22:50:51	taternuts	which was "FlashBuilder" aka eclipse
2013-02-12 22:50:52	taternuts	as far as the IDE
2013-02-12 22:51:12	Z_Mass	Have you done any cross platform stuff with mono?
2013-02-12 22:51:21	taternuts	nope
2013-02-12 22:51:41	taternuts	I've really only been programming for 2+ years
2013-02-12 22:51:56	taternuts	so I don't have experience on a bunch of different platforms
2013-02-12 22:52:00	SirSkidmore	ecnahc515: you're chance right?
2013-02-12 22:52:00	SirSkidmore	haha
2013-02-12 22:52:29	Z_Mass	Mono sounds cool but some stuff relies on windows still. For example Monogame (XNA) required VS to build the assets -_-
2013-02-12 22:52:44	taternuts	VS Express?
2013-02-12 22:52:52	taternuts	that's always free
2013-02-12 22:53:05	Z_Mass	Ya any version. It's more of a hassle than anything
2013-02-12 22:53:33	taternuts	yeah it is a lot to download/install for a ./make
2013-02-12 22:53:48	Z_Mass	I'm not sure VS plays too friendly with Wine, and I'd rather not waste disk space on a vm either
2013-02-12 22:54:30	taternuts	yeah I doubt it does
2013-02-12 22:54:43	Z_Mass	Oh speaking of windows stuff, I recently got a dreamspark account through school, anyone want a Win 8 key :D
2013-02-12 22:54:55	taternuts	haha dreamspark is the shit
2013-02-12 22:55:06	taternuts	I got my tuition back in downloads through that for some semesters
2013-02-12 22:55:22	taternuts	I actually just graduated, hahaha
2013-02-12 22:55:32	taternuts	04-12, damn proud
2013-02-12 22:55:43	Z_Mass	Dreamspark + websitespark = tons of free crap
2013-02-12 22:55:59	Z_Mass	Nice
2013-02-12 22:56:22	taternuts	I suck at school
2013-02-12 22:57:00	taternuts	I don't like to do things just to do things
2013-02-12 22:57:22	taternuts	I like to do things because they are fun and challenging and someone might use it
2013-02-12 22:57:42	taternuts	I had one class left to graduate this last semester
2013-02-12 22:57:51	Z_Mass	I hear ya.. One of my classes has us using dosedit
2013-02-12 22:58:10	taternuts	and it was a networking class that I just didn't want to do at all...so I made a deal with my younger brother to switch that class with his advanced web design class
2013-02-12 22:58:22	ChocolateEClaire	i feel like stabing myself in the face
2013-02-12 22:58:35	ChocolateEClaire	helping really clueless people with programming sucks
2013-02-12 22:59:03	taternuts	where @?
2013-02-12 22:59:13	ChocolateEClaire	not normal clueless but like brain has taken a holiday clueless
2013-02-12 22:59:18	Z_Mass	ChocolateEClaire: What could be more fun than debugging a while() inside 3 for loops
2013-02-12 22:59:32	ChocolateEClaire	they had to ask what to do next in the assignment
2013-02-12 22:59:38	ChocolateEClaire	and i said they needed to get input from the user
2013-02-12 22:59:47	ChocolateEClaire	and they went so i need to make a printf statement
2013-02-12 22:59:52	ChocolateEClaire	and i said yeah...
2013-02-12 23:00:12	ChocolateEClaire	and he said "what should it say"
2013-02-12 23:00:22	ChocolateEClaire	he has already previously written statements asking the user for an integer
2013-02-12 23:00:27	ChocolateEClaire	he couldn't figure out how to do it again
2013-02-12 23:00:32	taternuts	oh
2013-02-12 23:00:37	Z_Mass	facepalm
2013-02-12 23:00:41	ChocolateEClaire	and then we spent 20 minutes explaining how mod works with him saying that he understands mod
2013-02-12 23:00:52	ChocolateEClaire	and me going "ok, what do you get when you do 15 % 3" and he goes 5
2013-02-12 23:01:05	taternuts	well he kind of understands it
2013-02-12 23:01:12	taternuts	half of it
2013-02-12 23:01:12	ChocolateEClaire	he understands division
2013-02-12 23:01:22	ChocolateEClaire	so yeah, we finally figured that out
2013-02-12 23:01:47	ChocolateEClaire	and then i explained that he needed to do the next part of the assignment that checks to see if a number is divisible by 2 and 3
2013-02-12 23:02:22	ChocolateEClaire	and he goes ok so he asks the user for an integer and then says it is. i said ok try other numbers and he states that it will always say that it is divisible. so i was like... then test it to make sure it is?
2013-02-12 23:02:23	ChocolateEClaire	and he goes wha?
2013-02-12 23:02:40	ChocolateEClaire	and i said how did you figure out in an earlier program which number was bigger than the other
2013-02-12 23:02:47	Z_Mass	Sounds about like my programming class. That's pretty much everyones skill level, except we're making "games" with sdl. They think everything can be done with a for/while loop inside main()
2013-02-12 23:02:47	ChocolateEClaire	and he said "i ran it through the program"
2013-02-12 23:02:53	taternuts	oy vey
2013-02-12 23:03:12	ChocolateEClaire	he thinks scanf tests functions
2013-02-12 23:03:32	ChocolateEClaire	he decided that scanf("%i", %3); would work
2013-02-12 23:03:53	ChocolateEClaire	which is wrong on like 4000 ways
2013-02-12 23:04:03	--	SirSkidmore is now known as SirSkids|Zzz
2013-02-12 23:04:42	taternuts	see I had to google scanf, I've never touched c/c++
2013-02-12 23:04:51	ChocolateEClaire	ummm
2013-02-12 23:05:16	ChocolateEClaire	k
2013-02-12 23:05:32	taternuts	oh now I have to actually look at it and see what was wrong about it
2013-02-12 23:06:19	taternuts	oh nah I'm too drunk atm to do that
2013-02-12 23:07:41	taternuts	guess it's what String.format was patterned after I imagine
2013-02-12 23:08:12	ChocolateEClaire	essentially he was trying to do an if statement using an assignment operator
2013-02-12 23:08:14	ChocolateEClaire	ish
2013-02-12 23:08:22	ChocolateEClaire	scanf takes input and assigns it to a variable
2013-02-12 23:09:00	taternuts	haha oh ok I see
2013-02-12 23:09:17	taternuts	kind of what I thought but I'm not comfortable with c*
2013-02-12 23:10:42	taternuts	hopefully he'll come back to it in the morning and facepalm it
2013-02-12 23:10:55	taternuts	or his homework is due tonight in which case he's screwed

2013-02-13 08:51:57	@intothev01d	banks seriously need to come up with a better way of dealing with online transactions instead of every fucking merchant having your card number in a db
2013-02-13 08:53:10	@intothev01d	apparently somewhere i used my card had their "system compromised" and now they have to issue a new card, which just means i have to go and chance the card number everywhere i use to pay bills etc. they should really look into 2 factor authenticaion or some other types of verification of transactions and not have people actually give out their card number info. thats just asking for trouble
2013-02-13 08:53:23	@intothev01d	change*
2013-02-13 08:54:49	@intothev01d	how hard would it be to issue an ID number to use for a transaction. then when the transaction processes, you have to confirm it by logging into your bank or entering some 2 factor generated code so they know it's you. then they never have the card number, the merchant still gets their money, and its much more secure. it's not rocket scienct

2013-02-13 09:22:59	timgd	intothev01d: that sounds like an incredible hassle
2013-02-13 09:23:13	timgd	i can't imagine logging into my account and approving every transaction
2013-02-13 09:23:20	@intothev01d	which part? the card cancelling or beefing up security?
2013-02-13 09:23:43	@intothev01d	online transactions need some better way than spreading your card number around all over creations
2013-02-13 09:24:10	@intothev01d	and again, you could use some form of 2 factor auth like an app that generates the number (Google Authenticator and such)
2013-02-13 09:24:15	timgd	i don't think card numbers will be used much longer
2013-02-13 09:24:28	@intothev01d	it makes no sense to
2013-02-13 09:24:41	@intothev01d	you're basically relying on the merchant to implement security
2013-02-13 09:24:59	@intothev01d	spreading the thing your'e trying to protect all over creation makes it harder to protect
2013-02-13 09:25:34	timgd	all over creation.. not sure if religious or..
2013-02-13 09:25:41	@intothev01d	you can use one time card numbers i think for online transactions, but thats a buffer against the real problem
2013-02-13 09:26:03	@intothev01d	timgd: I'm a hardcore creationist!

2013-02-13 09:26:42	timgd	nah, you have some good things to say, creationist or not
2013-02-13 09:26:56	timgd	paypal disgusts me
2013-02-13 09:26:57	@intothev01d	Expez, yea you could, but paypal totally blows
2013-02-13 09:27:07	Expez	moneybookers aka skrill has two factor authentication
2013-02-13 09:27:09	@intothev01d	i think banks should provide that type of service
2013-02-13 09:27:13	@intothev01d	seems like they would anyway
2013-02-13 09:27:21	Expez	how does paypal blow?
2013-02-13 09:27:26	timgd	intothev01d: there's only one reason they don't. they have nothing to gain by it
2013-02-13 09:27:43	timgd	well, I guess they could tax the transfers
2013-02-13 09:27:55	@intothev01d	i use them but they will lock up your account in a second, hold funds etc.. I've not experienced it yet but a lot of pepole have problems with them
2013-02-13 09:28:08	timgd	yea, always take your money asap
2013-02-13 09:28:18	@intothev01d	timgd, they could save a shit load in fraud losses and monitoring etc
2013-02-13 09:28:20	timgd	i haven't tried google wallet yet
2013-02-13 09:28:20	Expez	why would you ever have money in your paypal account unless you're a merchant?
2013-02-13 09:28:31	timgd	Expez: that's the only reason
2013-02-13 09:29:28	@intothev01d	seems like a knowledgeable bank would have everything to gain by going to great lengths to protect their customers
2013-02-13 09:30:05	Expez	intothev01d: they have insurance.  If they could make a buck giving a shit they would.
2013-02-13 09:30:05	@intothev01d	but yea, right now they don't give a shit like most coroporations b/c they can just force people to deal with it because they're aren't many other options
2013-02-13 09:30:43	@intothev01d	even with insurance they have to pay a seemingly overactive fraud dept way to much whereas if they had security in mind it would be less prevelant
2013-02-13 09:31:06	@intothev01d	the cost in time of dealing with all of this, replacing stolen cards etc would be nullified by better security procedure
2013-02-13 09:34:04	@intothev01d	i mean, why don't they get really smart and have key encrypted logins and such? it seems to me like they are pretty lax on security policy which does cost them they just don't seem to understand how much. they  have to quantify all the time spent dealing with issues and irate customers by the thousands when this type of thing happens you would think it would be more cost effective and considerably better for the consumers that they are suppos

2013-02-16 17:21:37	chance	Z_Mass: what are you trying to accomplish
2013-02-16 17:22:28	chance	you want it to not resize if no one is viewing it..i dont get it..if no one is viewing it, what does it matter?
2013-02-16 17:23:13	chance	if your getting the problem where its the size of the smallest connected session, than use the -d arg when attaching. it doesnt get bigger than the smallest session attached
2013-02-16 17:25:29	Z_Mass	chance: Well for example if I have it open in a virtual console and then open it in a gui terminal, the virtual console ends up with dots all around the view
2013-02-16 17:27:05	Z_Mass	If both sessions are looking at window 1, it seems resonable, but if only one is looking at a given window I would assume no scaling is needed.
2013-02-16 17:28:33	Z_Mass	Not a huge issue though, I only usually program in the virtual consoles if I'm trying to avoid distractions. It's only when I need to test a game or something that I need both open

2013-02-16 17:50:30	chance	so you have to understand that just because you quit doesnt mean your no longer attached
2013-02-16 17:50:41	chance	thats the whole idea of tmux
2013-02-16 17:50:43	chance	you can attach. quit your computer, and still be attached
2013-02-16 17:51:10	chance	you might not be physically looking at it, but tmux doesnt know that, your still attached
2013-02-16 17:51:42	chance	fix it by detaching when done, or use tmux att -d
2013-02-16 17:54:45	Z_Mass	Ya I understand that. But it would be a hassle to detach from one everytime I need to test a change in my game or something. I'll try the -d option though and see if that helps.
2013-02-16 17:55:43	chance	well you only need to detach if your not going back to it immediately

2013-02-17 01:38:56	tangentstorm	no idea. i unplugged the machine while i was cleaning... turned it back on and when i log in i just get a white screen
2013-02-17 01:40:02	tangentstorm	but actually when i installed it, it wiped out my boot loader, and since i was reinstalling things, i restored the bootloader and booted up the haiku partition again.

2013-02-18 18:23:38	SirSkidmore	PyQt is good
2013-02-18 18:24:09	SirSkidmore	I think that's what they use for ubuntu apps

2013-02-18 21:14:08	SirSkidmore	Uh oh..
2013-02-18 21:14:17	SirSkidmore	Someone at my school died today
2013-02-18 21:14:24	SirSkidmore	She wasn't feeling well yesterday, went home earlu
2013-02-18 21:14:36	SirSkidmore	Friday^
2013-02-18 21:14:38	SirSkidmore	never woke up this morning
2013-02-18 21:28:15	SirSkidmore	and now there's a school-wide blackout tomorrow
2013-02-18 21:28:25	SirSkidmore	and I don't want to look like a dick, but I'm not going to do it
2013-02-18 21:28:47	SirSkidmore	I don't know this girl

2013-02-18 21:29:55	SirSkidmore	If I were her family or friends, I would be upset that everyone is essentially ow pretending they knew her

2013-02-18 21:55:16	robmadeyou|2	Eh, for me would be kind of the same
2013-02-18 21:55:49	SirSkidmore	Glad I'm not the only one
2013-02-18 21:55:50	SirSkidmore	heh
2013-02-18 21:57:39	robmadeyou|2	Do they know what happened to her though?
2013-02-18 21:57:42	SirSkidmore	no
2013-02-18 21:57:59	SirSkidmore	and I'm kind of more scared that she was contagious than anything else
2013-02-18 21:58:16	robmadeyou|2	That's the right kind of thing to be scared of
2013-02-18 21:59:10	robmadeyou|2	I guess I'll be seeing you on the news then pretty soon?
2013-02-18 21:59:10	SirSkidmore	doubtful
2013-02-18 21:59:26	SirSkidmore	A high schooler died? It's upsetting to the community but certainly not worth of anything national
2013-02-18 22:00:22	robmadeyou|2	I guess so; 7 billion people in the world.
2013-02-18 22:01:01	robmadeyou|2	Damn, that's bad of me to say; I am NOT implying it's okay to kill!
2013-02-18 22:05:55	chance	pft, killing is fine, murder is different
2013-02-18 22:06:04	SirSkidmore	shit
2013-02-18 22:06:19	chance	forgot you murdered someone?
2013-02-18 22:06:26	SirSkidmore	there's a movement to sue the doctor she supposedly saw on Friday
2013-02-18 22:06:28	SirSkidmore	what the fuck?
2013-02-18 22:06:29	SirSkidmore	back off
2013-02-18 22:06:39	SirSkidmore	It's no one's business besides her family's
2013-02-18 22:06:48	SirSkidmore	and why would you sue?
2013-02-18 22:07:11	chance	well, the doctor shouldnt be sued unless he was negligable
2013-02-18 22:07:22	SirSkidmore	She presented flu-like symptoms, and he gave her cold medicine? How is it his fault? Why would you sue someone for trying to help?
2013-02-18 22:07:27	SirSkidmore	Destroying his reputation
2013-02-18 22:07:30	SirSkidmore	and for what?
2013-02-18 22:07:35	SirSkidmore	a few thousand dollars?
2013-02-18 22:07:46	SirSkidmore	That'll help repay the loss of your daughter... how?
2013-02-18 22:07:53	chance	well, you could get millions if he seriously neglected something obvious
2013-02-18 22:08:26	chance	like..if she had a black spot on her chest which indicated something far worse than a cold, and all he did was give her cold medicine.
2013-02-18 22:08:40	chance	but it would need to be a situation similar to that..indicating true neglectfulness at his job
2013-02-18 22:08:55	SirSkidmore	I guess I can't speak for him
2013-02-18 22:08:57	SirSkidmore	but I doubt it...
2013-02-18 22:09:11	chance	probably not
2013-02-18 22:09:12	chance	but still
2013-02-18 22:09:12	chance	its possible
2013-02-18 22:09:27	SirSkidmore	I don't know
2013-02-18 22:09:29	chance	im just stating the conditions in which an investigation would have to find in order to go through a court case.
2013-02-18 22:09:57	chance	he *could* have made a stupid mistake, and not checked something out that he clearly should have
2013-02-18 22:09:57	chance	but he might not have
2013-02-18 22:09:57	SirSkidmore	I'm not going to her viewing, or her funeral, or participating in the blackout.
2013-02-18 22:09:57	chance	it could be a true accident
2013-02-18 22:10:07	SirSkidmore	I'm upset, but I literally have never heard of this girl until today
2013-02-18 22:10:20	SirSkidmore	and in a true tangent: chance you use arch right?
2013-02-18 22:10:38	chance	yeah
2013-02-18 22:11:11	SirSkidmore	does github look ridiculous to you?
2013-02-18 22:11:21	SirSkidmore	I'm just getting some sites to render really strangely
2013-02-18 22:11:21	chance	what woudl that have to do with arch
2013-02-18 22:11:38	SirSkidmore	Well, I emailed GH staff
2013-02-18 22:11:57	chance	it would be abrowser thing, or a problem on their end, but not a distro problem
2013-02-18 22:12:00	SirSkidmore	and he said it happened to him too; he was looking into it and thought it was the way arch handled fonts or something
2013-02-18 22:12:06	chance	i mean distros influence versions
2013-02-18 22:12:07	SirSkidmore	That's what I thought too
2013-02-18 22:12:22	chance	it could be that its a browser + font problem
2013-02-18 22:12:22	SirSkidmore	but it happens in FF, Chrome, and Konquerer
2013-02-18 22:12:27	chance	the default font might be messed up for your system
2013-02-18 22:12:35	chance	or whatever your browsers default to normally isnt there
2013-02-18 22:12:40	chance	and in that case, they'll use something else
2013-02-18 22:12:43	chance	shouldnt break anything.
2013-02-18 22:13:07	SirSkidmore	but it does
2013-02-18 22:13:07	chance	although they might have anticipated a certain font, which could break styling techncially..
2013-02-18 22:13:07	chance	but thats shame on them almost
2013-02-18 22:13:23	SirSkidmore	The "help" link in the navbar is never in the navbar
2013-02-18 22:13:32	SirSkidmore	and the problem isn't isolated to me
2013-02-18 22:13:48	SirSkidmore	and certain other sites look strange too
2013-02-18 22:13:51	chance	well it certainly could be a font issue
2013-02-18 22:14:05	chance	whats your default font in FF?
2013-02-18 22:14:06	chance	mines serif

2013-02-18 22:15:17	chance	idk
2013-02-18 22:15:20	chance	try installing some fonts?
2013-02-18 22:16:16	SirSkidmore	Thanks for the bug report. It's always nice to see a fellow Archer. I've tried to figure out what the deal is with that bug and I'm pretty sure it's something about the fonts on Archlinux. If I ever figure out what the deal is I'll drop you a line.
2013-02-18 22:16:19	SirSkidmore	found the emial
2013-02-18 22:18:01	SirSkidmore	I mean I have a ton of font packages installed
2013-02-18 22:18:11	SirSkidmore	and it doesn't look broken in Mint
2013-02-18 22:19:05	SirSkidmore	I'm just not going to worry about it

2013-02-19 16:55:04	jfredett	totally fine editor.
2013-02-19 16:56:37	jfredett	the more important thing is you stick with what's comfortable to use and makes coding easiest

2013-02-20 11:42:20	coalitians	I have a question though, why Can't I do a pull request from master branch. Do I always have to create a branch to send pull request?
2013-02-20 11:42:56	Expez	You can create pull requests from master, but you really shouldn't.
2013-02-20 11:43:32	Expez	Creating topic branches is a good habit to have

2013-02-20 11:47:14	coalitians	Thanks Expez. I didn't know you can thru master since only when I created a branch did I get an option to send pull request in the project git hub page.
2013-02-20 11:47:42	Expez	It's def possible, I still remember being scolded for doing so by SirSkidmore :)
2013-02-20 11:47:56	Expez	But I think github only makes it easy to create a PR if a topic branch is used.
2013-02-20 11:48:44	coalitians	Github Benevolent dictator, really nice.
2013-02-20 11:49:11	jfredett	Expez: yah, github notices branches and makes buttons for them on your fork and on upstream, iirc
2013-02-20 11:56:23	Expez	jfredett: I think it's time to try Emacs again: evil-mode went 1.0 last week.  Think it's a pretty complete Vim emulator now.

2013-02-20 11:56:41	Expez	I don't use the most obscure features though, but I can't tell the difference.

2013-02-20 12:12:28	jfredett	:)
2013-02-20 12:13:29	Expez	jfredett: Let's talk about the ruby load path
2013-02-20 12:14:46	Expez	Why do I have to do `ruby -I lib ...` to run Hatter?  Shouldn't RVM modify the load path to include the lib folder when the gemspec has 'gem.require_paths = ["lib"]?
2013-02-20 12:25:39	jfredett	no.
2013-02-20 12:25:44	jfredett	one sec
2013-02-20 12:29:03	<--	coalitians (~singular@219.91.209.158) has quit (Read error: No route to host)
2013-02-20 12:31:10	jfredett	rvm doesn't assume anything about gems. ever
2013-02-20 12:31:32	jfredett	the reason is that rvm in some sense predates what we now know as gems -- it used to be that there were many conventions
2013-02-20 12:31:38	jfredett	the only unifying property of which was the gemspec file
2013-02-20 12:32:02	jfredett	which told you what to do for a given gem -- eg, where things lived, paths to load, etc.
2013-02-20 12:32:32	jfredett	rvm is written in bash, which would mean it'd have to hook in, check for a .gemspec, interpret it, then modify things appropriately
2013-02-20 12:32:34	jfredett	this is made more difficult by the fact that .gemspec is arbitrary ruby
2013-02-20 12:33:04	jfredett	so it might, for instance, pull in libraries (like to get VERSION, or whatever)
2013-02-20 12:33:40	Expez	Emacs users have written a ton of nifty stuff for Ruby devs, but most of the cooler stuff depends on inf-ruby-mode which runs an IRB session inside Emacs.  The problem is every time I send code to this repl now it barfs at any and all require statements.
2013-02-20 12:33:43	jfredett	that might cause breakage, which means that you might have to try to recover from any number of major breakages because of ruby. rvm already had to deal with such things due to rvmrc
2013-02-20 12:34:05	jfredett	Expez: $:.unshift './lib'
2013-02-20 12:34:15	jfredett	alter the load path from in ruby. that'll usually fix it
2013-02-20 12:34:32	jfredett	you can add it to your .irbrc file/modify the emacs plugin somehow
2013-02-20 12:34:35	Expez	but I would like to do that programmatically
2013-02-20 12:35:10	jfredett	in particular, i'd do `$:.unshift './lib' if Dir.exists?('./lib')`
2013-02-20 12:35:10	jfredett	I think Dir#exists? is a thing.
2013-02-20 12:36:27	Expez	The problem is the current dir could be whatever, unless I manually change the working dir in emacs, so unshifting './lib' is likely to add a lot of weird stuff to path
2013-02-20 12:37:18	jfredett	hrm
2013-02-20 12:37:35	Expez	hmm, think Dir.pwd returns the dir of one of the editor windows
2013-02-20 12:38:10	jfredett	I don't know really how to tame inf-ruby-mode in emacs.
2013-02-20 12:38:24	jfredett	I imagine there is some way to say, "start always in the root of a gem dir
2013-02-20 12:38:39	jfredett	maybe some recursion -- cd.. until you find a .gemspec or something
2013-02-20 12:38:41	jfredett	or hit /
2013-02-20 12:39:38	Expez	the working dir seems to be set to the last file opened
2013-02-20 12:39:55	Expez	So I'll just automatically start an inf-ruby process when I open a ruby file if one doesn't exist and then alter the path in that context
2013-02-20 12:40:00	Expez	thanks for your help :)
2013-02-20 12:40:33	jfredett	Expez: fsure
2013-02-20 12:40:50	jfredett	maybe I'll try evil, but if it doesn't support :g//:normal, emacs is the worst tool ever. :)
2013-02-20 12:41:04	Expez	what does :g//:normal do?
2013-02-20 12:41:35	Expez	fwiw the only thing Evil doesn't aim to emulate is Vimscript, because elisp is strictly superior
2013-02-20 12:41:38	jfredett	:g = global, really there should be /re/ in the /'s (some regex)
2013-02-20 12:42:05	jfredett	:normal then says, "execute a command on every line that matches that regex
2013-02-20 12:42:29	Expez	give me a command and I'll try :P
2013-02-20 12:42:38	jfredett	so :g = go-find (globally), /re/ -- this regex,
2013-02-20 12:42:45	jfredett	then :normal -- switch to command mode and do the following command
2013-02-20 12:42:57	jfredett	so, :g/def/:normal yyGp
2013-02-20 12:43:11	jfredett	should print all the def lines at the bottom of a file
2013-02-20 12:43:26	jfredett	that is a moderately weird commands
2013-02-20 12:43:26	jfredett	command*
2013-02-20 12:44:20	jfredett	also, re VimScript, I don't know that elisp is strictly superior, esp. considering I can call ruby from vimscript and just use that.
2013-02-20 12:45:30	Expez	yeah, that totally didn't work
2013-02-20 12:45:30	Expez	lol

2013-02-20 12:45:30	jfredett	Emacs sucks.

2013-02-20 12:47:21	jfredett	how do I make emacs 24.2 install evil?
2013-02-20 12:47:22	jfredett	is there a invocation or do I need to download something manually
2013-02-20 12:47:49	Expez	we have a package manager
2013-02-20 12:47:50	Expez	but it's only setup to trust official packages by default
2013-02-20 12:48:07	Expez	there are other repos, for instance one which builds packages from git so you have the most recent stuff
2013-02-20 12:48:45	jfredett	how do I do that thing? ^x-^p-^a-^c-^k-^a-^g-^e, no doubt...

2013-02-20 12:50:15	Expez	then do M-x eval-buffer <RET>
2013-02-20 12:50:41	jfredett	how do I make a buffer?
2013-02-20 12:51:07	Expez	the default buffer is the scratch buffer, that one should do
2013-02-20 12:51:07	jfredett	okay
2013-02-20 12:51:32	Expez	if not just do `C-x b foo` to switch to a new buffer called 'foo'
2013-02-20 12:52:07	Expez	next step is M-x package-list-packages
2013-02-20 12:52:28	Expez	gives you a list of all the packages available for installation
2013-02-20 12:52:28	jfredett	the fuck -- it's already all vimmy.
2013-02-20 12:53:07	jfredett	emacs knows... man.
2013-02-20 12:53:07	Expez	C-s to search forward, for 'evil'
2013-02-20 12:53:07	jfredett	I think I've set this up before...
2013-02-20 12:53:07	jfredett	I'm going to blow away ~/.emacs
2013-02-20 12:53:20	Expez	would lose the settings you made last time
2013-02-20 12:54:45	jfredett	I don't remember what they were.

2013-02-20 12:55:53	jfredett	so now how do I install it?
2013-02-20 12:56:08	Expez	C-s lets you search, so search for 'Evil'
2013-02-20 12:56:10	jfredett	did

2013-02-20 16:07:07	Expez	he was complaining about the colors being 'all messed up'
2013-02-20 16:07:13	chance	they are messed up
2013-02-20 16:07:13	jfredett	it kindof looks like solarized, anyway
2013-02-20 16:07:18	chance	the gvim is fine.
2013-02-20 16:07:25	jfredett	they're different between gvim and term
2013-02-20 16:07:28	chance	the other one is weird
2013-02-20 16:07:35	chance	the urxvt in the background
2013-02-20 16:07:35	jfredett	you probably just need to do and echo $TERM
2013-02-20 16:08:00	jfredett	and see that you're running w/ 256 colors
2013-02-20 16:08:07	jfredett	ah- chance already said this
2013-02-20 16:08:17	jfredett	my work here is done, reposter, AWAY!!!
2013-02-20 16:08:30	 *	jfredett flys off, in a way strangely reminiscient of something you've seen recently.
2013-02-20 16:10:01	Expez	Will this work without having solarized colors set in xresources?
2013-02-20 16:10:11	SirSkidmore	I am
2013-02-20 16:10:23	SirSkidmore	:echo $TERM returns screen-256colors
2013-02-20 16:10:33	SirSkidmore	and :echo &t_Co returns 256
2013-02-20 16:10:45	Expez	SirSkidmore: do you have the solarized theme set in xresources?
2013-02-20 16:11:14	jfredett	Expez: it should
2013-02-20 16:11:14	Expez	pretty sure vim just asks for 'yellow' and then the terminal paints it with whatever color yellow is defined as in xresources
2013-02-20 16:11:14	jfredett	hmm
2013-02-20 16:11:19	jfredett	screen-256colors seems weird
2013-02-20 16:11:29	jfredett	Expez: no, vim can set diff colors than the term
2013-02-20 16:11:59	jfredett	because I can flip between light and dark mode
2013-02-20 16:11:59	jfredett	and the colors are not shared
2013-02-20 16:12:02	jfredett	(eg, they're not the same scheme)
2013-02-20 16:12:12	jfredett	then again, I have 256 colors on, so maybe...
2013-02-20 16:12:43	jfredett	hmmm.
2013-02-20 16:12:49	SirSkidmore	I have the solarized xresources set as my xresources
2013-02-20 16:13:17	jfredett	SirSkidmore: I seem to remember that the variables set in there caused weird issues
2013-02-20 16:13:29	jfredett	turned my term pink.
2013-02-20 16:13:30	jfredett	maybe something with that?
2013-02-20 16:13:59	SirSkidmore	I just pulled the repo
2013-02-20 16:13:59	SirSkidmore	reset everything
2013-02-20 16:14:02	SirSkidmore	ran xrdb
2013-02-20 16:14:08	SirSkidmore	same
2013-02-20 16:14:54	chance	jfredett: ive had that happen to

2013-02-20 16:16:12	jfredett	wrote a little vim macro to do it
2013-02-20 16:16:45	chance	lol
2013-02-20 16:16:47	SirSkidmore	I just want to know why everything looks like pastels
2013-02-20 16:16:54	SirSkidmore	heh
2013-02-20 16:19:02	jfredett	SirSkidmore: perhaps... maybe the variables got mismatched
2013-02-20 16:19:15	jfredett	eg, the colorscheme on the term is different than in gvim?
2013-02-20 16:19:30	jfredett	like, in the definition
2013-02-20 16:20:48	SirSkidmore	Well, you would think the colors would be the same then...
2013-02-20 16:21:01	SirSkidmore	OHHHHHHHHHHHH
2013-02-20 16:21:01	SirSkidmore	wait
2013-02-20 16:21:29	jfredett	I mean like, maybe some jackass decided to do `if g:gui ; <colorscheme> ; else <different scheme>`
2013-02-20 16:21:38	jfredett	with the sole purpose of pissing you off. :)
2013-02-20 16:22:02	SirSkidmore	Hold on
2013-02-20 16:22:05	SirSkidmore	let me see if I can get another color theme to look right

2013-02-20 16:48:44	jfredett	it's on the list for my revolution.
2013-02-20 16:48:50	Expez	but want to automate that completely so that when I open a ruby file it will check if an inferior ruby is running, if not, start one and add the current project to path

2013-02-21 15:47:39	@intothev01d	nope. are you making a game or something Z_Mass?
2013-02-21 15:56:45	SirSkidmore	okay
2013-02-21 15:56:46	SirSkidmore	question?
2013-02-21 15:56:46	jfredett	go for it
2013-02-21 15:57:47	SirSkidmore	So, a guy from the hackerspace offered me a late 2010 MBP, 500GB HDD, 8GB RAM, 2.4 GHz dual core duo, and 22 inch Dell monitor for $600
2013-02-21 15:57:50	SirSkidmore	Worth it?
2013-02-21 15:57:50	<--	blognewb (~blognewb@unaffiliated/blognewb) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2013-02-21 16:00:07	jfredett	SirSkidmore: can you test them out first?
2013-02-21 16:00:42	SirSkidmore	I mean, I've seen the guy working on it a lot
2013-02-21 16:00:42	SirSkidmore	I've sat next to him
2013-02-21 16:00:42	jfredett	2010 is a bit on the old side, but the monitor isn't bad (assuming its 1920x1080 and of reasonable visual quality)
2013-02-21 16:00:42	SirSkidmore	doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it
2013-02-21 16:00:48	timgd	whats an m8p
2013-02-21 16:00:55	SirSkidmore	I mean, it's not Retina, and not i5
2013-02-21 16:01:01	@intothev01d	thats not a bad deal at all. I have a 2010 myself. you can price it out on http://www.mac2sell.net/ to get an idea of what it is worth

2013-02-21 16:01:27	jfredett	I have a early/mid 2011 mbp, quad i7, not bad there, Dualcore makes me a bit nervous
2013-02-21 16:01:27	timgd	teamviewer microfonts
2013-02-21 16:01:27	jfredett	but if it's 600$ for the lot of it, it's probably worth it.
2013-02-21 16:01:27	@intothev01d	ive had no problems with mine
2013-02-21 16:01:44	SirSkidmore	intothev01d: are you on a core 2 duo?
2013-02-21 16:01:44	@intothev01d	yep
2013-02-21 16:01:59	SirSkidmore	I mean, this is something I plan on replacing eventually anyway
2013-02-21 16:02:00	SirSkidmore	And I really don't use laptops a whole lot
2013-02-21 16:02:03	@intothev01d	thats a good deal though I would think
2013-02-21 16:02:12	jfredett	SirSkidmore: if you got the coin to spare
2013-02-21 16:02:13	@intothev01d	if it all works properly
2013-02-21 16:02:13	jfredett	and it all works
2013-02-21 16:02:13	SirSkidmore	yeah
2013-02-21 16:02:29	jfredett	it's worth it

2013-02-21 16:02:44	timgd	i had an ipod once. i knew that i wasn't an apple person after that

2013-02-21 16:03:11	jfredett	I couldn't live with less than 15"

2013-02-21 16:03:59	jfredett	nope
2013-02-21 16:04:07	@intothev01d	i don't think they can catch you on it if it's in an IRA though
2013-02-21 16:04:28	jfredett	rebase freely, destroy history, it's not upstream so it's all good.
2013-02-21 16:04:28	Expez	jfredett: Won't it be a bit of a mess for you to see what's changed?
2013-02-21 16:04:33	@intothev01d	you should look into a Roth IRA. you can gain alot, tax free, while you're young.
2013-02-21 16:04:44	jfredett	Expez: the comments will look a bit fucked, but I don't mind.
2013-02-21 16:04:59	jfredett	intothev01d: FAFSA takes into account total assets, iirc
2013-02-21 16:05:03	Expez	jfredett: aright.  Suppose it's more important that the history is nice and tidy once it's merged in.
2013-02-21 16:05:08	@intothev01d	even retirement accounts?
2013-02-21 16:05:12	@intothev01d	thats shitty
2013-02-21 16:05:36	jfredett	iirc, yah

2013-02-21 16:06:45	@intothev01d	you have to list contributions as income, but you'd be doing that anyway if you're making money

2013-02-21 16:07:55	@intothev01d	SirSkidmore, thats a good deal for the computer though, mac2sell quote at 830 for just the mbp
2013-02-21 16:09:53	SirSkidmore	cool

2013-02-21 16:10:41	jfredett	SirSkidmore: buy it and flip it! free monitor + some dime. mang.
2013-02-21 16:10:41	SirSkidmore	jfredett: I mean I really want a rumoured retina MBA
2013-02-21 16:11:11	SirSkidmore	So I mean, at the end of the year when they get announced, it should still have at least $600 of value
2013-02-21 16:11:13	@intothev01d	they have the retina mbpro (thats a ssd and retina display and all) basically an air but a bit bigger
2013-02-21 16:11:38	jfredett	the retina MBP's are nice
2013-02-21 16:11:41	jfredett	bossman has one
2013-02-21 16:11:41	@intothev01d	you could turn around and sell that stuff on ebay for like 800 or more right now I bet

2013-02-21 16:13:06	SirSkidmore	I mean, I've been wanting a Mac for a while
2013-02-21 16:13:06	SirSkidmore	I mean, I'll definitely use it
2013-02-21 16:13:11	Z_Mass	intothev01d: Not yet, thankfully. Was just wondering if it was something widely used.
2013-02-21 16:13:12	@intothev01d	well either way it's a good deal if it's all in good working order
2013-02-21 16:13:46	SirSkidmore	and he's throwing a magic trackpad
2013-02-21 16:13:51	SirSkidmore	heh
2013-02-21 16:14:01	Z_Mass	I asked my teacher if I could use SFML or the Python SDL bindings for my labs and he said I needed to know SDL/C since we would be using it for the iPhone next year -_-
2013-02-21 16:14:06	@intothev01d	Z_Mass, i don't think it's as prominent as some other solutions
2013-02-21 16:14:22	@intothev01d	SirSkidmore, if you don't want it, I"ll buy it :D
2013-02-21 16:14:36	@intothev01d	lol
2013-02-21 16:14:47	Z_Mass	I'm not suprised. Not a big fan of sdl myself lol
2013-02-21 16:15:07	SirSkidmore	Well he's asking $800 from other people
2013-02-21 16:15:15	SirSkidmore	He's just cutting me a deal
2013-02-21 16:15:16	SirSkidmore	haha
2013-02-21 16:15:19	@intothev01d	get it while you can
2013-02-21 16:15:32	@intothev01d	if it checks out and all
2013-02-21 16:16:02	@intothev01d	i would think it will hold what you pay for it for at least the next year or more. macs tend to hold value pretty well
2013-02-21 16:16:31	@intothev01d	however with their updated release cycles not as much but still good
2013-02-21 16:16:31	Expez	Baller emacs usage of the day: Use color-moccur to search for all lines containing "def" in the entire ruby project.  Get a list of hits placed in a buffer.  Edit the lines in question to add parens to function. essentially editing across files by moving by lines in this special buffer :)
2013-02-21 16:17:04	tangentstorm	neat!
2013-02-21 16:18:45	jfredett	Expez: :g/def/normal fflr($)
2013-02-21 16:18:45	jfredett	^-- in vim, I believe. :)
2013-02-21 16:19:04	jfredett	edits in place, no buffer or anything
2013-02-21 16:19:08	jfredett	and only one file
2013-02-21 16:19:08	Expez	jfredett: I just edited across files.  That one only edits within file.
2013-02-21 16:19:23	jfredett	I imagine there is a variant of :g for across files
2013-02-21 16:19:30	jfredett	but I don't know it
2013-02-21 16:19:47	Expez	Yeah, usually a ton of ways to do this stuff
2013-02-21 16:20:40	Expez	Could easily do this with a a shell glob to find all .rb files in the directory tree and then use a ruby or perl oneliner to do the edit :P
2013-02-21 16:20:56	tangentstorm	jfredett: you said something yesterday about not being able to use the mouse in emacs in tmux in a terminal... i do this all the time...
2013-02-21 16:20:56	jfredett	if I needed to, find + sed
2013-02-21 16:20:56	jfredett	:)
2013-02-21 16:21:03	Expez	or that
2013-02-21 16:21:03	jfredett	tangentstorm: OSX?
2013-02-21 16:21:12	jfredett	I don't really need it
2013-02-21 16:21:17	jfredett	but it'd be interesting to know why/how to make it work
2013-02-21 16:21:29	tangentstorm	jfredett: hmm. i'm on linux, but i imagine it should work on osx too
2013-02-21 16:21:50	tangentstorm	do you have mouse support in tmux usually?
2013-02-21 16:22:04	SirSkidmore	god
2013-02-21 16:22:04	SirSkidmore	I have to wear a bowtie for my gig tonight
2013-02-21 16:22:10	SirSkidmore	Don't know how to tie a bowtie
2013-02-21 16:22:35	jfredett	tangentstorm: dunno, never tried, don't think so
2013-02-21 16:22:35	jfredett	I don't really use the mouse anyway, so it's not much of an issue
2013-02-21 16:22:36	jfredett	SirSkidmore: the internet knows.
2013-02-21 16:22:47	SirSkidmore	I'm trying to watch videos
2013-02-21 16:22:48	SirSkidmore	haha
2013-02-21 16:23:32	tangentstorm	(xterm-mouse-mode t) maybe?
2013-02-21 16:24:40	jfredett	is that tmux or emacs?
2013-02-21 16:24:46	tangentstorm	emacs
2013-02-21 16:24:47	jfredett	in something in .emacs?
2013-02-21 16:24:49	tangentstorm	though it seems to have broken my mouse support
2013-02-21 16:25:01	tangentstorm	you can just type elisp anywhere and type C-x C-e
2013-02-21 16:25:05	tangentstorm	put the cursor right after the close paren
2013-02-21 16:25:31	jfredett	o.o, my .emacs is empty. dafuq.
2013-02-21 16:25:31	jfredett	ooh- it's .emacs.d
2013-02-21 16:25:46	tangentstorm	that stuff is auto-generated
2013-02-21 16:26:04	jfredett	oh - I forgot my shit was all broken
2013-02-21 16:26:16	tangentstorm	right now i'm getting scroll wheel support but nothing else.. hrm
2013-02-21 16:26:44	tangentstorm	oh. menu-bar-mode lets me use the menu with a mouse... but no drag to select... maybe tmux is interfering
2013-02-21 16:27:26	tangentstorm	i normally use the keyboard too anyway :)
2013-02-21 16:29:24	jfredett	yah, it's more of a curiousity
2013-02-21 16:29:32	jfredett	20 years of Vim have effectively weened my need for rodentia
2013-02-21 16:30:46	Expez	You started using Vim at 5?

2013-02-21 16:44:29	tangentstorm	have you guys seen this learntris thing?
2013-02-21 16:44:29	jfredett	squish w/o having to edit the message
2013-02-21 16:44:29	jfredett	so good
2013-02-21 16:45:02	jfredett	tangentstorm: I saw it, but did not recognize the github name as being someone hwo is in here often
2013-02-21 16:45:02	tangentstorm	i'm sort of mentoring-by-default here, though not much is going on
2013-02-21 16:45:47	tangentstorm	i had suggested someone make tetris and i guess 3 or 4 people are now collaborating
2013-02-21 16:46:37	jfredett	tangentstorm: I've noticed that the overall function of LPMC is more about troubleshooting nontrivial programming / design level questions than it is about actually collaborating on projects -- the latter seems to come in fits and starts
2013-02-21 16:46:37	jfredett	I'm pretty okay with that
2013-02-21 16:46:40	jfredett	the goal was a place for post-newb learning, I think we've succeeded in that at least, though not in the way I thought we would.
2013-02-21 16:47:16	tangentstorm	i still like the idea of helping people to collaborate on projects
2013-02-21 16:47:35	jfredett	yah- and it's not like we don't do that, just we don't do as much of it as I thought we would.
2013-02-21 16:47:47	tangentstorm	in fact, i had wanted to do something like that and then LPMC appeared :)
2013-02-21 16:48:28	jfredett	it had been tossed around a few times in /r/learnprogramming. I'd talked about doing a post-newbie podcast type thing with someone
2013-02-21 16:48:42	jfredett	never really got off the ground (time issues, naturally.
2013-02-21 16:48:46	jfredett	)
2013-02-21 16:49:01	tangentstorm	the tetris thing came from this:

2013-02-21 16:51:03	@intothev01d	people actually have to contribute and write code for something before they make a pull request :D
2013-02-21 16:51:25	tangentstorm	well... i plan to do a lot more along those lines in the not too distant future
2013-02-21 16:51:29	Expez	We might think about how we might better engage these other people though
2013-02-21 16:51:32	jfredett	Expez: it's easy to sign up, but hard to contribute, so naturally there is some attrition of people who like it in theory, but don't have the time/energy to like it in practice.
2013-02-21 16:51:42	tangentstorm	i'm closing in on a release for retro pascal
2013-02-21 16:52:06	jfredett	Expez: it's tough, we can't really get to them if they aren't here, or in /r/lpmc, or on our completely tumbleweeded mailinglists
2013-02-21 16:52:11	tangentstorm	once i have that, i'll be cranking out video lessons
2013-02-21 16:52:15	@intothev01d	thats just it. people like the idea of it mostly, but then they kind of stop as soon as the new wears off (which is usually kind of quick)
2013-02-21 16:52:25	jfredett	However, if you're volunteering for the position of community engagement engineer
2013-02-21 16:52:27	Expez	jfredett: I think it's very hard to get started working on a project without coming to this IRC channel talking to the mentor in charge.
2013-02-21 16:52:29	jfredett	:)
2013-02-21 16:52:42	 *	jfredett looks for his box of badges
2013-02-21 16:52:46	Expez	jfredett: I don't think we can expect people to just randomly start submitting PRs to projects just because it is in the language they want to learn.
2013-02-21 16:52:51	tangentstorm	there are also about 0 next actions available for people to work on :)
2013-02-21 16:52:52	jfredett	*nod*
2013-02-21 16:53:08	<--	jfredett (~jfredett@pool-108-20-240-138.bstnma.east.verizon.net) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2013-02-21 16:53:29	@intothev01d	i think one thing would be to list more issues that need work in the open projects
2013-02-21 16:53:32	@intothev01d	yea what tangentstorm said
2013-02-21 16:53:45	-->	jfredett (~jfredett@pool-108-20-240-138.bstnma.east.verizon.net) has joined #lpmc
2013-02-21 16:54:03	Expez	tangentstorm: That might be the biggest problem.  Especially for projects that are well under way like the IRC bots.  Where do I start?  Can be a hard question to answer.
2013-02-21 16:54:22	tangentstorm	with this learntris thing... they seem to be sort of self-organizing
2013-02-21 16:54:33	@intothev01d	libastar and percival make good use of issues with actionable items to work on
2013-02-21 16:54:36	jfredett	Expez, tangentstorm -- these are all completely valid and totally real problems
2013-02-21 16:54:57	tangentstorm	i really intended it as a solo activity, since it's small and everyone knows how it's supposed to work already
2013-02-21 16:55:02	tangentstorm	but these guys wanted to work together
2013-02-21 16:55:05	@intothev01d	we have a few dead ends as well that haven't had any work / mentors left or whatever
2013-02-21 16:55:56	jfredett	I have no idea how to solve them, and am well open to ideas, so long as my involvement in implementation is minimal (but only because I'm already running at my limit)
2013-02-21 16:56:18	SirSkidmore	He's throwing is PS6 and MS Office too :D
2013-02-21 16:56:31	jfredett	I wish I had more time to spend. I feel bad that I can't sort of... drive things around here more
2013-02-21 16:56:35	@intothev01d	for one we prob need to close LPMCBot if hamper is the active python bot project. that lead to some confusion earlier. if we have a few solid projects to focus on we can work to make more actionable items that people could contribute to
2013-02-21 16:56:47	tangentstorm	I was kind of thinking maybe I would do a recurring "tetris workshop", limited to n people... and just start the project over for each group
2013-02-21 16:56:58	jfredett	tangentstorm: thats a good idea
2013-02-21 16:57:10	jfredett	intothev01d: ibid.
2013-02-21 16:57:21	@intothev01d	?
2013-02-21 16:57:37	tangentstorm	we were talking about that the other day in #learnprogramming... thats why i just had them fork it, and haven't pulled in their changes
2013-02-21 16:57:57	jfredett	intothev01d: 'ibid' -- 'as above', eg: it is also a good idea
2013-02-21 16:58:01	@intothev01d	ah
2013-02-21 16:58:04	@intothev01d	gotcha
2013-02-21 16:58:30	jfredett	tangentstorm: I should really be in that channel too, but it's hard to manage all of the channels I'm in already. so much input, so little bandwidth
2013-02-21 16:58:32	tangentstorm	i was thinking i might update the master repo with some basic questions from the design doc
2013-02-21 16:58:57	@intothev01d	so then active we have hamper, percival, hatter, learntris..
2013-02-21 16:59:18	tangentstorm	retro is very active, just not in public :)
2013-02-21 16:59:36	@intothev01d	what about LPMCCasino… that had 1 person ever working in it and then the maintainer has vanished
2013-02-21 17:00:29	tangentstorm	dunno. the Elm guy started his work at google... I haven't even seen him in chat for weeks, though he's still active on the mailing list
2013-02-21 17:00:46	tangentstorm	Ledger is switching to Haskell
2013-02-21 17:01:18	tangentstorm	i know neither of those have been at all active in here, but i've talked to them in the past, and they're kind of waiting on me i guess
2013-02-21 17:01:21	@intothev01d	those are forks as well right?
2013-02-21 17:01:26	jfredett	I have to hoof home, I'll be back in a while.
2013-02-21 17:01:32	jfredett	sorry to bail on important talking
2013-02-21 17:01:34	tangentstorm	also that hedgehog game
2013-02-21 17:01:41	@intothev01d	hedgehog game?
2013-02-21 17:01:53	tangentstorm	http://www.hedgewars.org/
2013-02-21 17:01:54	tamper	http://bit.ly/157Txoa - Title: Hedgewars
2013-02-21 17:02:07	tangentstorm	hedgewars is especially interesting because it may have google summer of code funding
2013-02-21 17:02:08	@intothev01d	ah ok
2013-02-21 17:02:17	@intothev01d	yea that I thought was a good idea
2013-02-21 17:02:45	@intothev01d	people have big interests in programming for games specifically anyway, plus they make good long running actionable projects
2013-02-21 17:02:54	tangentstorm	i mentored in gsoc for parrot vm... the whole parrot/perl6 community is kind of imploding recently
2013-02-21 17:03:04	tangentstorm	oh!
2013-02-21 17:03:14	Expez	tangentstorm: is ledgering being re-written by jwiegley in Haskell?
2013-02-21 17:03:19	tangentstorm	Expez: yes
2013-02-21 17:03:40	@intothev01d	so.. if no objections, I'm going to close LPMCCasino so we have one less on the list
2013-02-21 17:03:40	tangentstorm	Expez: he got a job doing haskell, and there is already a haskell port
2013-02-21 17:04:19	Expez	intothev01d: seems a waste after writing all those specs.  All we need is someone interested in working with Java and makign a casino :P
2013-02-21 17:04:33	tangentstorm	intothev01d: sounds good to me. you could always also ping the author and mention that you did this, in case he wants to come back
2013-02-21 17:04:33	Expez	tangentstorm: I know.  He's one of my personal heros
2013-02-21 17:04:34	@intothev01d	which hasn't happened in months :D
2013-02-21 17:04:43	tangentstorm	oh it's not made?
2013-02-21 17:04:57	tangentstorm	i've never even looked at it :)
2013-02-21 17:04:57	@intothev01d	yea I'll work on notifying him
2013-02-21 17:05:03	Expez	tangentstorm: Tons of specs only
2013-02-21 17:05:10	tangentstorm	yeah, johnw is cool
2013-02-21 17:05:32	tangentstorm	i've been using ledger for ages, that's why he was one of the first people i talked to about mentoring
2013-02-21 17:05:55	Expez	tangentstorm: He was too busy?
2013-02-21 17:06:03	<--	jfredett (~jfredett@pool-108-20-240-138.bstnma.east.verizon.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2013-02-21 17:06:16	tangentstorm	no he was enthusiastic, but so far i haven't had any students for him :)
2013-02-21 17:06:32	Expez	tangentstorm: he seems to inhale like normal people, but then exhales code or something.
2013-02-21 17:06:42	tangentstorm	:)
2013-02-21 17:06:42	Expez	Only way to explain how someone can write so much code
2013-02-21 17:07:00	Expez	It must be a bodily function for him
2013-02-21 17:07:16	tangentstorm	more importantly, he /ships/ it :)
2013-02-21 17:07:24	Expez	yes
2013-02-21 17:07:35	Expez	He's also like the most advanced emacs user in the world
2013-02-21 17:07:41	tangentstorm	and markets it... i have like 023984702394802348230498234 terraflops of python code i'm just sitting on
2013-02-21 17:07:53	Expez	He printed out the entire emacs manual and read it while waiting for builds etc
2013-02-21 17:08:00	tangentstorm	hahaha
2013-02-21 17:08:03	tangentstorm	that's cool
2013-02-21 17:08:27	Expez	Anyway, I would totally be his student
2013-02-21 17:09:05	tangentstorm	about a year ago, after using emacs for over a decade, i sat down and did nothing but study emacs and org-mode for about a week
2013-02-21 17:09:41	tangentstorm	https://github.com/sabren/b4/wiki/ScreenShots
2013-02-21 17:10:16	Expez	oh yeah?
2013-02-21 17:10:19	tangentstorm	^ managed to get that up and running (outlines + literate programming)... very cool
2013-02-21 17:10:20	Expez	org-mode is pretty powerful
2013-02-21 17:10:42	Expez	I really like the 'reproducible science' movement--and not just how they base their work on org-mode!
2013-02-21 17:10:49	tangentstorm	but i still feel like i've just scratched the surface of what emacs can do
2013-02-21 17:11:01	Expez	Having an executable academic paper is just the best
2013-02-21 17:11:30	Expez	Recently tried implementing some deep belief neural networks based on academic papers, and that was not a pleasant experience
2013-02-21 17:11:39	tangentstorm	i've been porting that book on symbolic programming in pascal to org-mode, and the minesweepr code was all in org-babel
2013-02-21 17:12:29	tangentstorm	Expez: if you want to do some volunteer work for ledger, that can totally be arranged
2013-02-21 17:13:23	Expez	tangentstorm: I would love that, but it would have to be down the line.  Trying to write my master thesis atm and don't want to abandon Hatter for Ledger.
2013-02-21 17:13:40	Expez	Having quite a bit of fun working with Ruby
2013-02-21 17:14:36	@intothev01d	also we might as well ditch LPMCBot in favor of hamper ( not much happened with it anyway before we started working with hamper )
2013-02-21 17:15:11	tangentstorm	what's your thesis on, Expez?
2013-02-21 17:15:47	Expez	tangentstorm: It's in the early stages but will be about spiking neurons and reinforcement learning, most likely
2013-02-21 17:16:05	SirSkidmore	intothev01d: can I put a Fusion drive in this puppy?
2013-02-21 17:16:30	@intothev01d	is that the ssd/normal hd combo thing?
2013-02-21 17:16:36	SirSkidmore	or a SSD at all
2013-02-21 17:16:41	@intothev01d	they had problems so I wouldn't. just go full SSD
2013-02-21 17:16:41	SirSkidmore	I just want a SSD
2013-02-21 17:16:44	SirSkidmore	okay
2013-02-21 17:17:04	@intothev01d	http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/OWC/
2013-02-21 17:17:05	tamper	http://bit.ly/157UNrB - Title: OWC Mercury Pro SSD - Solid State Drives using High Performance SandForce Processor solution
2013-02-21 17:17:12	Expez	tangentstorm: most artificial neural networks have neurons where the signal propagation between neurons is abstracted away.  Spiking neurons actually simulate the spiking part and propagation delay betwee neurons
2013-02-21 17:17:32	SirSkidmore	can I install one myself?
2013-02-21 17:17:43	@intothev01d	those.. they are beast. I have one in my mac mini (you'll just need the 3G ones though since the 6 Gb/s connectors are not in the 2010 models)
2013-02-21 17:18:29	@intothev01d	SirSkidmore, yea it's not hard at all
2013-02-21 17:18:48	@intothev01d	I would recommend fresh install the os though after you get the SSD
2013-02-21 17:19:28	SirSkidmore	BOOYAH
2013-02-21 17:19:43	SirSkidmore	intothev01d: he was going to do a fresh install tonight so I could pick it up tomorrow
2013-02-21 17:20:11	@intothev01d	cool yea the thing is the ssd will have nothing you'll have to install it and boot from disc anyway and install the os
2013-02-21 17:20:35	tangentstorm	Expez: i took a neural networks course in college. i really liked the material, but the course was incredibly slow for me and i wound up dropping it
2013-02-21 17:20:54	@intothev01d	I would get at least a 120 GB SSD
2013-02-21 17:21:36	tangentstorm	kind of think i hurt the professor's feelings, because i'd asked to be in the class and seemed to be the only person in there that understood what he was talking about :)
2013-02-21 17:21:46	Expez	tangentstorm: haha
2013-02-21 17:22:23	SirSkidmore	can I have both the ssd and the hdd?
2013-02-21 17:23:06	@intothev01d	you'd have to get a data doubler and remove the superdrive
2013-02-21 17:23:22	SirSkidmore	data doubler... superdrive?
2013-02-21 17:23:32	@intothev01d	http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other+World+Computing/DDAMBS0GB/
2013-02-21 17:23:37	tangentstorm	at one point i was working on a tool that would let you take a description of a neural net as a network and would compile it to the equivalent  matrix

2013-02-23 17:30:34	tangentstorm	so in forth you might define a word that added two numbers like so:       : add + ;
2013-02-23 17:30:51	tangentstorm	+ already does the work of taking two numbers off the stack, adding them and putting the sum on the stack
2013-02-23 17:30:58	tangentstorm	: is the word to define a new word
2013-02-23 17:31:02	tangentstorm	add is the word being defined
2013-02-23 17:31:16	tangentstorm	and the semicolon turns off the compiler
2013-02-23 17:31:31	tangentstorm	so the next thing you type gets executed immediately instead of being compiled into the "add" word
2013-02-23 17:31:51	tangentstorm	now i will go read the weechat manual so i can translate this into colorforth :)
2013-02-23 17:32:02	Expez	lol
2013-02-23 17:32:49	Expez	With the huge RAM of modern computers, an operating system is no longer necessary, if it ever was. colorForth includes multi-tasking, and drivers for essential devices. But that is hardly an operating system in the style of Windows or Linux.
2013-02-23 17:33:25	tangentstorm	add + ;
2013-02-23 17:33:51	tangentstorm	yeah
2013-02-23 17:34:05	tangentstorm	colorforth was originally written for the pc in assembly (most forths are)
2013-02-23 17:34:27	tangentstorm	you can boot it directly, or at least you could in 199x
2013-02-23 17:34:54	Expez	seems the greenarrays just keep the source code and just re-compile it if they need something lol
2013-02-23 17:35:49	tangentstorm	in forth you have blocks.. a block is 1kb of text
2013-02-23 17:36:32	tangentstorm	btw, most modern forths have file system access and gui routines and floating point and all that, but i'm talking about chuck moore style forth and colorforth here
2013-02-23 17:37:09	tangentstorm	so in that world, you have blocks instead of files
2013-02-23 17:37:36	tangentstorm	and if you look at old forth listings (like that winfield pascal thing), you'll see it's  broken into blocks of 64x16 characters
2013-02-23 17:38:07	tangentstorm	64x16 = 256 * 4 bytes/character = 1k
2013-02-23 17:39:09	tangentstorm	i think originally it was probably 256-byte blocks
2013-02-23 17:39:31	tangentstorm	64x16 definitely does not equal 256
2013-02-23 17:40:06	tangentstorm	i confused myself there :)
2013-02-23 17:40:40	Expez	Charles Moore is 75.  Doesn't seem to be slowing down much heh
2013-02-23 17:40:57	tangentstorm	64*16 = 1024 ... so you'd load that 1k block from disk, show it on the screen
2013-02-23 17:41:06	tangentstorm	your machine in those days probably had about 4k
2013-02-23 17:41:10	tangentstorm	of ram
2013-02-23 17:41:39	tangentstorm	so having two of those blocks in ram was all you afford
2013-02-23 17:42:25	tangentstorm	assuming maybe ... 256 bytes or so for forth itself, and another 1-2k for all your dat
2013-02-23 17:42:27	tangentstorm	data
2013-02-23 17:44:24	tangentstorm	hmm. i don't think 256 bytes is unreasonable for the core interpreter. the two stacks would probably be at least 64 bytes each...
2013-02-23 17:44:57	tangentstorm	now i want to actually try this
2013-02-23 17:45:04	Expez	haha
2013-02-23 17:45:59	tangentstorm	there's a guy that hangs out in #retro who is making a new retro-like language with 4-bit instructions.
2013-02-23 17:46:11	tangentstorm	so 16 core opcodes, packed 2 to a byte
2013-02-23 17:47:05	tangentstorm	he just pretends it's 256 instructions because it's more efficient to work with bytes on intel
2013-02-23 17:48:05	 *	tangentstorm wonders how big stoneknife forth is
2013-02-23 17:51:32	tangentstorm	he says his source code is 1902 bytes, but i'm not sure what that means exactly.
2013-02-23 17:51:37	tangentstorm	https://github.com/kragen/stoneknifeforth  ... bunch of stuff in the project
2013-02-23 17:51:49	tangentstorm	and it's not really forth
2013-02-23 17:54:01	Expez	tangentstorm: you done some stuff with django, right?
2013-02-23 17:58:12	tangentstorm	yep
2013-02-23 17:58:40	Expez	I don't know anything about webdev
2013-02-23 17:58:54	Expez	Can you make stuff look good, for some value of good, without being an artist?
2013-02-23 17:59:28	Expez	Do you even need art assets?  Or is it all just generated by code someone has written?
2013-02-23 17:59:45	tangentstorm	might i recommend: http://www.amazon.com/The-Non-Designers-Design-Book-Typographic/dp/1566091594
2013-02-23 18:00:33	Expez	You may
2013-02-23 18:00:56	tangentstorm	also: view source on practically any web page. what browser do you tend to use?
2013-02-23 18:01:05	Expez	Conkeror!
2013-02-23 18:05:21	Expez	I interpret your answer to be that I can get pretty far without diving into photoshop or in-design or whatever
2013-02-23 18:12:02	tangentstorm	Expez: you should be able to install firebug in corkeror... i haven't tried it
2013-02-23 18:12:41	tangentstorm	or you can really just use firefox's normal debug tools
2013-02-23 18:12:57	tangentstorm	oh.. really don't know what's in conkeror or not.
2013-02-23 18:14:10	tangentstorm	actually, it really doesn't matter for what i'm talking about. i normally browse in firefox but the other day i started with a blank html page and tried to see if i could make a web page without using anything but a browser
2013-02-23 18:14:38	tangentstorm	i tried both firefox + firebug and plain old chromium
2013-02-23 18:14:40	tangentstorm	http://tangentcode.com/
2013-02-23 18:14:44	tangentstorm	that's the web page i made
2013-02-23 18:15:05	tangentstorm	the only other tool i used was emacs briefly: to save the finished page to disk when i was done
2013-02-23 18:15:39	tangentstorm	i know it's not a beautiful page :)
2013-02-23 18:15:42	tangentstorm	but you can open up the developer tools and change the html and css directly
2013-02-23 18:15:44	tangentstorm	interactively i mean
2013-02-23 18:16:15	tangentstorm	it's easy to look at a site, go into the dev tools and see what they did to make it work that way
2013-02-23 18:16:41	tangentstorm	firefox's "inspect element" even has an option to render the blocks of the page in 3d so you can see how elements are nested
2013-02-23 18:35:00	Expez	yeah
2013-02-23 18:36:35	Expez	Feel like I have to get into some 'webstuff'
2013-02-23 18:37:23	Expez	Have an idea for a webapp.  Starting to think making a webapp should be this years summer project.
2013-02-23 18:37:42	tangentstorm	the way i saved my work while i was doing that was to use the localStorage object... that was fun to play with
2013-02-23 18:38:21	Expez	Start work in 1. September and hand in my thesis 20th of June.  Def enough time :)
2013-02-23 18:38:51	Expez	Have had internsips the last couple of years over the summer, so will be nice to be able to work on something of my own all summer
2013-02-23 18:39:19	Expez	this is just html, css and some js right?
2013-02-23 18:40:07	Expez	'just' :D  Guess that's most of what the web is lol
2013-02-23 18:40:07	tangentstorm	yep
2013-02-23 18:40:08	tangentstorm	also yep
2013-02-23 18:40:48	tangentstorm	the code in the text area is javascript that uses d3.js, which is a really nice library for visualizing things
2013-02-23 18:40:51	tangentstorm	or for generating html views from data

2013-02-25 15:20:00	brhCS	anyone here?
2013-02-25 15:21:08	tangentstorm	just ask whatever you really want to ask :)
2013-02-25 15:22:28	brhCS	I just discovered this community today and was wondering where the projects are, but now I've found some now that I've looked outside the standards-and-practices repo :)
2013-02-25 15:22:39	Expez	hi
2013-02-25 15:23:46	brhCS	I don't see anything in Java, though; do you guys have any recommendations for where to start / how to look for a project / what to do?
2013-02-25 15:24:33	Expez	brhCS: we could start a java project if you want
2013-02-25 15:24:33	Expez	brhCS: What skill level are you?
2013-02-25 15:24:42	tangentstorm	i have a java project...
2013-02-25 15:24:54	Expez	well there you go
2013-02-25 15:24:57	Expez	tangentstorm: what is it? :P

2013-02-25 15:25:39	tamper	http://bit.ly/11F15j0 - Title: GameSketchLib
2013-02-25 15:25:39	brhCS	I'm not really sure of my skill level.  I just got a CS degree and have done a number of projects for school, but don't have any real work experience or open source contribution experience so I guess I'm a beginner?
2013-02-25 15:27:26	tangentstorm	brhCS: what do you want to do ?
2013-02-25 15:29:24	brhCS	Well, I'm doing job applications and would like to do something that I can talk about in interviews when they ask me about project experience, and I'd just like to build my confidence and familiarity with open source coding
2013-02-25 15:29:24	brhCS	not really looking to do any specific project or build and particular application
2013-02-25 15:29:25	brhCS	(yet)
2013-02-25 15:33:43	brbcoding	Figure out something that you'll use, brhCS... I built a little Java app that queries a MS SQL database or a MySQL database...
2013-02-25 15:33:55	brbcoding	When I was a freshman or sophmore.
2013-02-25 15:34:22	brbcoding	Because I wanted to query the DB faster and without running SQL MGMT Studio or MySQL workbench
2013-02-25 15:34:43	brbcoding	Stuff like that makes interviewers fall in love
2013-02-25 15:34:58	brhCS	What was the database for?
2013-02-25 15:34:58	brbcoding	ANything
2013-02-25 15:35:15	brhCS	I don't use any databases in my day to day stuff, so I'm just curious
2013-02-25 15:35:44	brbcoding	Well when I did it, I was querying student records
2013-02-25 15:36:29	brbcoding	but it was just a random DB to use
2013-02-25 15:36:30	tangentstorm	yeah... knowing about databases definitely helps
2013-02-25 15:37:17	brhCS	Someone posted a free SQLite3 tutorial book a while ago and I worked through some of the exercises to get to know a little SQL
2013-02-25 15:37:32	brhCS	maybe I should go back to finish and master it
2013-02-25 15:37:46	tangentstorm	it helps to have an application
2013-02-25 15:37:47	brbcoding	master the book maybe, not sql :P
2013-02-25 15:39:03	tangentstorm	because NoSQL is the future or because you'd prefer D?

2013-02-25 15:41:18	brhCS	yeah, by "master" I basically just meant "minimally competent and capable of working through some basic examples" :)

2013-03-18 09:58:45	jfredett	which is a lovely (free) book on precisely what it says on the tin, "How to design programs"
2013-03-18 09:59:01	Z_Mass	I'm signed up for the Coursera course by the creator of Scala (who better to learn from lol)
2013-03-18 09:59:03	jfredett	SirSkidmore: it's a perfectly fine language, it's just not particularly functional.
2013-03-18 09:59:18	jfredett	Z_Mass: yah- it's not a bad language by any stretch
2013-03-18 09:59:34	jfredett	my concerns have to do with how easy it is to break the soundness of their types
2013-03-18 09:59:44	jfredett	and cause some evil to occur in the type system
2013-03-18 09:59:51	jfredett	but I'm also the sort of person who does that
2013-03-18 09:59:54	jfredett	so... YMMV
2013-03-18 10:00:34	Z_Mass	Ya, I've never done functional stuff so I'm not familiar with the crazy type systems, so I probably won't be doing too much advanced stuff at first
2013-03-18 10:01:22	Z_Mass	I found this last night, we seems interesting http://reia-lang.org/
2013-03-18 10:01:24	tamper	http://bit.ly/107zZ2e - Title: Reia Programming Language
2013-03-18 10:10:12	jfredett	Reia is neat
2013-03-18 10:10:17	jfredett	sort of erlangy, iirc
2013-03-18 10:10:43	Z_Mass	Ya, a sort of Ruby clone built on Erlang
2013-03-18 10:13:39	SirSkidmore	like Mirah for Erlang?
2013-03-18 10:15:32	Z_Mass	Not sure, but it says it runs on the Erlang VM
2013-03-18 10:24:02	SirSkidmore	yeah
2013-03-18 10:24:10	SirSkidmore	Mirah is a ruby-like language for the JVM
2013-03-18 10:34:25	SirSkidmore	http://michaux.ca/articles/scheme-from-scratch-bootstrap-v0_1-integers I really wish this went into more depth than what it does :/

2013-03-18 22:05:20	chance	ah
2013-03-18 22:05:21	SirSkidmore	so I needed User.where(email: @user.email).exists?
2013-03-18 22:05:37	chance	i would just do a selevt

2013-03-18 22:06:12	SirSkidmore	All I want is to check for existence though
2013-03-18 22:06:37	chance	thats exactly what that does except you can reuse the user object now if you need :D
2013-03-18 22:07:35	chance	for example, say you want to say "you've already register {{ user.name }}"
2013-03-18 22:07:47	chance	or you want to redirect them to a login with their username filled out already
2013-03-18 22:07:47	chance	:)
2013-03-18 22:09:10	SirSkidmore	I don't need that for that chance
2013-03-18 22:09:23	SirSkidmore	This is more accurately described as a "Subscriber" than a user
2013-03-18 22:09:43	chance	true.
2013-03-18 22:09:46	SirSkidmore	this is a temporary model so I can send newsletters for our pilot events and real registrations
2013-03-18 22:09:52	chance	althourgh a subscribe _is_ a type of 'user'
2013-03-18 22:10:24	chance	but yeah, makes sense :)
2013-03-18 22:10:57	SirSkidmore	Well, the way I was doing it in my head
2013-03-18 22:11:55	SirSkidmore	was that a Subscriber (at this point) is only going to receive newsletters
2013-03-18 22:12:06	SirSkidmore	They need no authentication, have a SUPER ismple model and controller
2013-03-18 22:12:09	SirSkidmore	and no views
2013-03-18 22:12:20	SirSkidmore	other than subscribers#new
2013-03-18 22:12:36	SirSkidmore	they're there for me SOLEY to send them newletters
2013-03-18 22:12:37	chance	what about potential subscriptions for other things
2013-03-18 22:12:43	SirSkidmore	they literally have no other purpose
2013-03-18 22:12:51	SirSkidmore	chance: I'm fleshing out a real user model
2013-03-18 22:12:53	chance	or your signed up users and their subscriptions
2013-03-18 22:12:56	SirSkidmore	This is a temporary site
2013-03-18 22:13:09	chance	maybe you would want a subscription object

2013-03-19 21:55:11	SirSkidmore	Let me look into installing it on mac
2013-03-19 21:56:01	expez	might start with aquamacs
2013-03-19 21:56:18	expez	think that's 99% emacs, and just a little stuff to make it feel like an ios program
2013-03-19 21:56:40	expez	would recommend actually just using emacs proper though
2013-03-19 21:56:46	expez	probably pick up some bad habits from aquamacs
2013-03-19 21:58:03	SirSkidmore	Okay, I'll install marmalade now

2013-03-19 22:05:29	SirSkidmore	have you seen this?
2013-03-19 22:05:43	expez	yes
2013-03-19 22:06:32	expez	there are a few of these types of projects around, aiming at providing an environment with better defaults for emacs
2013-03-19 22:07:06	expez	depending on the amount of time you are willing to tweak stuff to get it just the way to you like, this might be a good way to go
2013-03-19 22:08:01	SirSkidmore	I already got the standard starter kit
2013-03-19 22:08:30	expez	I spent quite a bit of time browsing through peoples emacs repositories on github when I first started out.  Seeing what kind of setup they used and then reading major/minor-modes and settings with emacs self-documentation
2013-03-19 22:10:00	expez	totally stealing that esk-remove-elc-on-save function
2013-03-19 22:13:07	expez	recommend doing `C-h t' btw
2013-03-19 22:13:23	SirSkidmore	I don't get cordinating major/minor things
2013-03-19 22:13:26	SirSkidmore	Major is language
2013-03-19 22:13:31	SirSkidmore	usually?
2013-03-19 22:13:48	expez	you only have one major mode active at any given time
2013-03-19 22:13:53	expez	but you can have several minor modes
2013-03-19 22:15:11	expez	so when you're doing programming the major mode is typically like java-mode or haskell-mode, but if you're doing writing it might be markdown mode or latex mode
2013-03-19 22:15:32	expez	at the same time you'll have minor modes like auto-complete activated
2013-03-19 22:16:39	SirSkidmore	Okay
2013-03-19 22:16:55	SirSkidmore	So I raell like this theme: http://emacsfodder.github.com/blog/soothe-theme/

2013-03-20 22:22:57	taternuts	SirSkidmore: how'd everything shake out with your scholarship stuff
2013-03-20 22:23:34	SirSkidmore	I got an extra $500/year!
2013-03-20 22:23:55	taternuts	sweet
2013-03-20 22:23:57	SirSkidmore	So I'm getting 9.5k out of 24K paid >.>
2013-03-20 22:24:02	taternuts	oh
2013-03-20 22:24:08	SirSkidmore	Compared to 27k of 24k
2013-03-20 22:25:36	taternuts	guess you'll just have to join the ranks of those with college loan debt
2013-03-20 22:26:15	taternuts	at least you're not offsetting it with an Art History degree
2013-03-20 22:26:54	taternuts	you'll be able to put off the majority of the payments until you graduate, and my guess is you'll be able to find a company willing to help you with the loans
2013-03-20 22:28:45	taternuts	but I mean yeah, definitely still sucks
2013-03-20 22:31:07	SirSkidmore	YEah
2013-03-20 22:31:12	SirSkidmore	I'm not terribly worried about it
2013-03-20 22:31:20	taternuts	yeah I bet
2013-03-20 22:31:21	SirSkidmore	I'm pretty sure I'll be pretty hireable
2013-03-20 22:31:43	taternuts	if I was a dedicated as you are at your age, I feel like I'd be ruling the world right now
2013-03-20 22:34:16	taternuts	if you have some nice code examples and show your passion, you're ahead of most college grads
2013-03-20 22:34:22	SirSkidmore	I just wish I had more time!
2013-03-20 22:34:26	SirSkidmore	Especially for Hatter

2013-03-20 22:35:19	SirSkidmore	and it'll be F/OSS haha
2013-03-20 22:35:24	SirSkidmore	Doesn't get better than that
2013-03-20 22:35:29	taternuts	there you go man
2013-03-20 22:37:06	taternuts	you're about to embark on one of the greatest learning experience of your life (college), which also happens to be the most fun
2013-03-20 22:37:57	SirSkidmore	I don't know why people keep telling my high school is the best
2013-03-20 22:37:58	SirSkidmore	so far it sucks... a lot
2013-03-20 22:38:10	taternuts	I sucked at high school, I was really shy and stuff
2013-03-20 22:38:20	taternuts	loved lacrosse, was good at that
2013-03-20 22:38:35	taternuts	I joined a fraternity in college and really had a blast
2013-03-20 22:39:02	taternuts	met some of my best friends, had some times that rival the "college experience" movies

2013-03-20 22:47:04	taternuts	we lived right next to Lola's Avellanas, pretty much a "dream bar"
2013-03-20 22:47:16	taternuts	walked over there when we had time off of work, which tbh wasn't that often

2013-03-20 22:50:28	taternuts	you don't have to worry about financial stuff as much as you do
2013-03-20 22:50:55	taternuts	if you don't want to be a programmer for the rest of your life, you'll still get paid because you know how to do it
2013-03-20 22:51:11	taternuts	you'll get paid pretty well off the bat and you will continue to make that money
2013-03-20 22:51:45	taternuts	get a remote position and backpack europe :)

2013-03-20 23:28:37	SirSkidmore	Well, a DRum Major conducts for a marching band ;)
2013-03-20 23:28:50	taternuts	oh ok
2013-03-20 23:28:59	SirSkidmore	So I was the guy on the podium haha
2013-03-20 23:29:13	taternuts	still though, danny carey is pretty good
2013-03-20 23:29:21	SirSkidmore	Honestly, it's by far the most involved student leadership role in high school
2013-03-20 23:29:51	SirSkidmore	I mean, as drum major I ran rehearsals by myself, knew all of the individual parts, understood the theory of how the music worked
2013-03-20 23:30:08	taternuts	I've always wanted to learn music theory
2013-03-20 23:30:19	SirSkidmore	If you name any tempo between 60 and 200 beats per minute I can snap it within 10 bpm ;)
2013-03-20 23:30:34	SirSkidmore	not to toot my own horn, but I was pretty damn good :P
2013-03-20 23:30:37	SirSkidmore	Anyway
2013-03-20 23:30:46	SirSkidmore	I really need to get going to bed :)
2013-03-20 23:30:54	taternuts	yeah, I'm thinking the same thing
2013-03-20 23:30:59	SirSkidmore	Thanks for letting me tell you my boring life story haha
2013-03-20 23:31:08	taternuts	thanks for listening to mine

2013-03-21 21:07:10	tangentstorm	It's perfectly legal to play, it's just illegal for a site to let you transfer money to it with a credit card.
2013-03-21 21:07:23	tangentstorm	Or from your bank directly.
2013-03-21 21:07:28	SirSkidmore	wait
2013-03-21 21:07:30	SirSkidmore	what?
2013-03-21 21:07:34	SirSkidmore	really?

2013-03-21 21:07:39	Z_Mass	So how do you get money to it?
2013-03-21 21:07:45	tangentstorm	Exactly.
2013-03-21 21:07:53	Z_Mass	Heh, prepaid cards? :D
2013-03-21 21:08:01	tangentstorm	Western Union
2013-03-21 21:08:10	tangentstorm	Basically it just doesn't happen.
2013-03-21 21:08:14	Z_Mass	Lame
2013-03-21 21:09:00	Z_Mass	My cousin just got back from a 3 month trip around Asia/Europe and parts of Western Canada. He was "working" while skiing at Whistler
2013-03-21 21:09:04	tangentstorm	For a long long time you could just do bank transfers, but then some dude at the DOJ went nuts and siezed the domains of the 4 or so largest ones.
2013-03-21 21:09:50	Z_Mass	DOJ = government?
2013-03-21 21:09:56	tangentstorm	Department of Justice, sorry.

2013-03-21 21:11:24	tangentstorm	Actually I haven't seen pop-up spam anywhere in ages.
2013-03-21 21:12:10	Z_Mass	We also don't have fancy things like hulu, so I use these tv sites that are loaded in videos that require like three pop-up closes lol
2013-03-21 21:12:24	@intothev01d	torrents. nuff said
2013-03-21 21:12:25	@intothev01d	:P
2013-03-21 21:13:32	@intothev01d	i subscribe to netflix myself and installed an hd antenna to pick up local stations b/c cable or satellite is ridiculous. i torrent the rest
2013-03-21 21:14:26	@intothev01d	i read somewhere yesterday though that Verizon is considering offering tv as a pay-for-what-you want type thing soon. its pretty much inevitable (just look at music)
2013-03-21 21:14:37	Z_Mass	I need an extra hd lol, for now streaming is easier :)
2013-03-21 21:15:22	Z_Mass	Ya.. No one wants to watch reruns anymore
2013-03-21 21:15:43	@intothev01d	actually i watch plenty of older stuff on netflix (sitcoms etc)
2013-03-21 21:15:54	@intothev01d	its just people dont want to pay for crap to get 1 or 2 good shows
2013-03-21 21:16:03	Z_Mass	But do you watch that older stuff 3 times a week? :D
2013-03-21 21:16:19	@intothev01d	this is really no different than music labels wanting to sell cds versus single songs
2013-03-21 21:16:37	@intothev01d	i mean, this all took place 15 years ago with napster and the music industry
2013-03-21 21:16:48	@intothev01d	now we have plenty of ways to get the types of music we want
2013-03-21 21:17:17	@intothev01d	just a matter of time for tv. im kind of surprised it hasn't happened already but it makes sense b/c of internet speeds. now they can manage it
2013-03-21 21:17:29	@intothev01d	back then it wouldn't be possible to stream content
2013-03-21 21:17:45	Z_Mass	After tv, we need google-fiber everywhere

2013-03-21 21:18:24	@intothev01d	fiber would be awesome but telecoms don't want to pay for it
2013-03-21 21:18:29	tangentstorm	In washington state it actually is illegal to play poker online. You can buy and smoke pot, but you can't play cards.
2013-03-21 21:18:41	@intothev01d	we already get gouged on wireless, and they have fiber its just outrageous
2013-03-21 21:18:53	@intothev01d	tangentstorm: thats pretty stupid
2013-03-21 21:20:29	tangentstorm	It's just annoying. I could make a living playing poker. :)

2013-03-21 23:12:55	@intothev01d	she is
2013-03-21 23:12:57	@intothev01d	and stupid
2013-03-21 23:13:28	@intothev01d	dangerous combo
2013-03-21 23:13:43	expez	pretty sure she's quite capable and intelligent
2013-03-21 23:13:53	expez	which makes this all so confusing
2013-03-21 23:16:00	@intothev01d	i dont think she is though. some of her comments are so far off base i can't see how any rational or intelligent person would make them
2013-03-21 23:16:35	expez	the blog reads like she's so wrapped up in her own crusade that she's seeing problems to solve where there are none
2013-03-21 23:16:49	@intothev01d	self fulfilling prophecy and such. she wants to be a martyr but not even good at that
2013-03-21 23:19:24	@intothev01d	take this one for instance. prob my favorite one so far http://imgur.com/5tbXR2c
2013-03-21 23:19:40	@intothev01d	what kind of sense does that make?
2013-03-21 23:19:56	expez	lol
2013-03-21 23:20:43	@intothev01d	it seems she can joke with people she knows, in public b/c it happens on twitter, however if she overhears someone joking with someone they know in a public place it's offensive if she doesn't happen to like it
2013-03-21 23:21:39	@intothev01d	very hypocritical and i think she proves that with the racism statement as well
2013-03-21 23:22:11	@intothev01d	they weren't addressing her directly either is the point. she just happened to hear it
2013-03-21 23:22:11	@intothev01d	http://i.imgur.com/nRC5J7f.png
2013-03-21 23:22:43	expez	yeah was looking for that
2013-03-21 23:22:56	expez	don't see how the joke they made, in private, is any worse than that one, which was made in public
2013-03-21 23:23:00	@intothev01d	exactly
2013-03-21 23:23:53	expez	this gossip stuff feels like such a guilty pleasure
2013-03-21 23:23:58	expez	but it's so funny
2013-03-21 23:24:37	expez	like the HN crowd probably usually doesn't read celebrity gossip magazines but every so often HN blows up completely when something like this happens in the tech community :P
2013-03-21 23:24:46	@intothev01d	yea its gossip on the base level but it does draw attention to the broader issue of political correctness in public, people's hypocrisy, and how much things can get blown way out of proportion
2013-03-21 23:25:20	expez	like the last time, when that chick re-invented the wheel and as ridiculed on twitter by some ruby celebrities, that gossip thread had like 1k+ comments lol
2013-03-21 23:25:32	@intothev01d	totally uncalled for as well, on their part
2013-03-21 23:25:43	expez	certainly
2013-03-21 23:26:15	@intothev01d	it is funny that such small things turn into big events though
2013-03-21 23:26:15	expez	but I felt like the media storm was unwarranted and just happened because the community was in the mood to gossip :P
2013-03-21 23:26:53	@intothev01d	possibly
2013-03-21 23:26:59	expez	as an aside all the major stories have involved females in tech
2013-03-21 23:27:01	expez	not sure we're doing them any favors lol
2013-03-21 23:27:27	@intothev01d	eh, the first one no. the second one she brought this on herself. she was the attacker in a sense
2013-03-21 23:28:20	@intothev01d	the more females in tech the better. i think everyone should just get off of the social media and get back to programming and building cool shit :P
2013-03-21 23:28:20	expez	for sure
2013-03-21 23:30:02	expez	filled up my fridge in panic yesterday
2013-03-21 23:30:03	expez	was in the store and saw all this easter shit out
2013-03-21 23:30:15	expez	been burned before where all the stores were closed and I had fuck all in the fridge lol
2013-03-21 23:30:35	@intothev01d	lol yea
2013-03-21 23:30:35	expez	Had to drag my sorry ass to the gas station and have hotdogs for dinner
2013-03-21 23:31:04	expez	turns out all the holidays aren't until next week :D
2013-03-21 23:33:08	@intothev01d	my town seems to think its two weeks. they have the dates wrong...

2013-04-22 12:30:02	chance	^^
2013-04-22 12:32:20	jfredett	I've heard it a few times about feynman, once about Gauss, and a few times about einstein
2013-04-22 12:33:16	jfredett	in fact, I think that's the first time I've heard it with Dantzig
2013-04-22 12:44:31	expez	I have heard about professors slipping unsolved problems into homework/tests, but haven ever heard of cases where a solution was handed in :P
2013-04-22 12:46:53	jfredett	my Algebra Professor put in "Find a closed form solution to the Quintic"
2013-04-22 12:46:58	jfredett	protip, there isn't one.
2013-04-22 12:47:31	expez	You think this is actually a good exercise?
2013-04-22 12:48:28	jfredett	Eh, I think it's fun for guys like me, because I often know that they aren't solvable
2013-04-22 12:48:32	jfredett	and so I get to bullshit
2013-04-22 12:49:40	expez	Being able to spot hard problems is definitely a valuable skill, like not spending time trying to solve something that is NP-hard, but I have a feeling it's very hard in the general sense.
2013-04-22 12:50:16	biio	you know, I wouldn't be surprised if our linear algebra professor made the exam 80% unsolved proofs
2013-04-22 12:50:26	expez	lol
2013-04-22 12:50:40	biio	she was not really a pleasant nor popular person
2013-04-22 12:57:29	jfredett	expez: So long as they're bonus problems, I don't mind if they're unsolvable, and who knows -- you might get lucky

2013-04-25 00:41:52	Z_Mass	Man I wish mysql had some better error messages for syntax stuff. A nice little ^ like the clang messages would be great.
2013-04-25 00:42:23	Z_Mass	"Error near: start_of_big_statement_...." is not too helpful lol
2013-04-25 00:42:35	tangentstorm	i think you get underlines and junk in the workbench. not sure. it's been a while.
2013-04-25 00:43:33	tangentstorm	maybe i just got so used to debugging those things that it stopped bothering me :)
2013-04-25 00:44:23	Z_Mass	Oh I didn't even think of trying to put it through the workbench. Right now the table creates are in the php code so I just have mysqli::error to help
2013-04-25 00:45:36	Z_Mass	Speaking of which, would that be bad practice? Should the page just expect there to be a properly set up db?
2013-04-25 00:46:11	tangentstorm	i think drupal and wordpress have a good approach.
2013-04-25 00:46:44	tangentstorm	they both have a setup process that kicks in if the db isn't there... but they're for people to download and install.
2013-04-25 00:47:24	tangentstorm	if it's just on your server you should trap the error if you can't connect, but otherwise you should assume it's up and running.
2013-04-25 00:47:43	Z_Mass	Ya, this is for a lab, so the teacher might be trying it on his pc too. 
2013-04-25 00:47:50	Z_Mass	I just do a create if not exists

2013-04-25 00:48:09	Z_Mass	cool, now to find the error :)
2013-04-25 00:48:33	Z_Mass	Do you know if mysqli doesn't like two creates in one db query?
2013-04-25 00:48:40	tangentstorm	but you can also put all that in a *.sql file for syntax highlighting and whatnot, and then just read that file.
2013-04-25 00:48:52	tangentstorm	i've never seen two in one query...
2013-04-25 00:49:35	tangentstorm	that's probably your error.. AFAIK, you issue statements one at a time
2013-04-25 00:49:59	tangentstorm	and call execute for each one, rather than separating by semicolons.
2013-04-25 00:50:09	Z_Mass	That might be it then. Ya sublime manages to highlight the sql in the strings, vim not so much. but sublime can't do string replace with the s/old/new syntax -_-
2013-04-25 00:50:23	Z_Mass	I'll split it up and let you know if that does it :)
2013-04-25 00:52:05	tangentstorm	cool
2013-04-25 00:53:31	Z_Mass	errno 150 now, something to do with a foreign key it seems
2013-04-25 00:55:15	tangentstorm	yeah that's not a very good error :D
2013-04-25 00:56:05	Z_Mass	Haha, it helps when I use the right table/variable names. I was looking at some sql I wrote before and ended up using it's variables

2013-06-04 15:23:07	expez	Had about it in school like 3 years ago but was like "LOL never gonna be db admin. This is lame!"
2013-06-04 15:23:15	expez	Turns out SQL is pretty useful
2013-06-04 15:23:59	expez	Have a really hard time learning stuff if I don't find it either interesting or because it seems obviously useful
2013-06-04 15:24:31	expez	So every now and again I have to go back and relearn stuff I could've learned in school if I wasn't such a dumbass :P
2013-06-04 15:25:54	expez	So, it's time to learn to do a bit more than create and drop tables :)
2013-06-04 15:26:30	expez	IIRC I was doing expected value calculations for poker during all the db lectures lol
2013-06-04 15:35:50	SirSkidmore	yeah

2013-06-04 15:36:25	SirSkidmore	trying to learn C#
2013-06-04 15:36:27	SirSkidmore	haha
2013-06-04 15:36:51	expez	C# is pretty sweet and Visual Studio is pretty good
2013-06-04 15:37:11	expez	Especially if you the resharper plugin, from the same peple who make intellij, and that vim plugin
2013-06-04 15:37:47	SirSkidmore	so I'm learning C# and PowerShell to script out all of the data-retrievals from the databases, virtual machines, and other stuff

2013-08-12 10:58:12	SirSkidmore	hey zachmassia
2013-08-12 10:59:01	zachmassia	Hey
2013-08-12 11:00:30	SirSkidmore	what's up?
2013-08-12 11:03:57	zachmassia	Not too much, just playing around with the go wiki web server tutorial
2013-08-12 11:04:00	zachmassia	You?
2013-08-12 11:09:55	SirSkidmore	Working on a few Clojure things I've been meaning to get around to forever
2013-08-12 11:10:04	SirSkidmore	almost mad at myself I've been ignoring it so much
2013-08-12 11:16:29	bnjdavis	Sir
2013-08-12 11:17:42	SirSkidmore	sup bnjdavis ?
2013-08-12 11:17:43	bnjdavis	SirSkidmore: Just checked and my optical drive supports dvds
2013-08-12 11:17:48	SirSkidmore	okay
2013-08-12 11:17:50	SirSkidmore	hmm
2013-08-12 11:17:55	SirSkidmore	have you tried a different DVD?
2013-08-12 11:17:57	SirSkidmore	:P
2013-08-12 11:18:06	SirSkidmore	that's about all I can think of at th emoment
2013-08-12 11:22:20	bnjdavis	yeah... curiouser and curiouser.  I have.  And now I can't even get a cd to work
2013-08-12 11:23:21	bnjdavis	Disk Utility is also saying that this blank CD-R has a capacity of 0 bytes...
2013-08-12 11:23:22	bnjdavis	Same with the blank DVD
2013-08-12 11:23:23	bnjdavis	Well there's the problem.
2013-08-12 11:24:22	SirSkidmore	hm
2013-08-12 11:24:25	SirSkidmore	that's odd
2013-08-12 11:24:27	SirSkidmore	for sure
2013-08-12 11:24:35	SirSkidmore	are you sure theyre blank?
2013-08-12 11:26:49	@jfredett	why do you need to write a CD in the first place?
2013-08-12 11:27:50	SirSkidmore	jfredett: I don't think his PowerBook G4 can boot from a USB, can it?
2013-08-12 11:27:59	 *	jfredett wonder's if there is a solution which does not require technology that should probably die the same death that VCRs did
2013-08-12 11:28:02	@jfredett	hmm
2013-08-12 11:28:19	@jfredett	uuh… probably not
2013-08-12 11:30:26	tangentstorm	g4 macs are awesome
2013-08-12 11:30:51	tangentstorm	you just have to learn to think of them as preconfigured forth systems that just happen to have some gui mac stuff too :)
2013-08-12 11:30:58	@jfredett	tangentstorm: ...
2013-08-12 11:31:07	@jfredett	go home, tangent, you're talking about forth again
2013-08-12 11:31:11	SirSkidmore	tangentstorm: you mean YOU think of them as preconfigured forth machine
2013-08-12 11:32:09	tangentstorm	i mean that's what they are :)

2013-08-12 11:33:05	tangentstorm	hold down   Command, Option, O, and F  when you first power on and then you'll get the open firmware forth system

2013-08-12 13:52:43	SirSkidmore	jfredett: that sounds fun
2013-08-12 13:52:55	SirSkidmore	I could dig that
2013-08-12 13:53:35	@jfredett	SirSkidmore: I'll probably muck around and see what gets started on my train tonight, but I'll fork it over to LPMC probably
2013-08-12 13:53:52	SirSkidmore	If you do, I'll definitely try to help

2013-08-12 13:54:23	@jfredett	I want it to have a really simple commandline tool — so I can do `bishop 'game-name' 'e4' —format=algebraic`
2013-08-12 13:54:26	@jfredett	so something like it
2013-08-12 13:54:36	@jfredett	with the default format being two-move or something like it
2013-08-12 13:54:40	SirSkidmore	whoa
2013-08-12 13:54:41	SirSkidmore	neat
2013-08-12 13:54:44	SirSkidmore	that would be cool
2013-08-12 13:54:45	@jfredett	and then it just PUTs to the game

2013-08-12 13:54:56	SirSkidmore	I would definitely be all over that
2013-08-12 13:55:06	@jfredett	then I could layer an Ember.js server or something
2013-08-12 13:55:13	@jfredett	s/server/app/
2013-08-12 13:55:13	tamper	jfredett actually meant: then I could layer an Ember.js app or something
2013-08-12 13:55:35	@jfredett	probably use Mnesia or whatever KVS is convenient for Erlang
2013-08-12 13:55:53	@jfredett	but my preference has always been for slow chess
2013-08-12 13:56:35	@jfredett	I've been thinking about designing a board game, too, so this'll be a good experiment for designing a boardgame-style server
2013-08-12 13:59:48	SirSkidmore	jfredett: board games are fun
2013-08-12 14:00:00	@jfredett	mhm
2013-08-12 14:00:04	SirSkidmore	My gf got me Catan, as my dog ate my old copy :(
2013-08-12 14:00:10	@jfredett	I'd like to design a panzer-leader like game
2013-08-12 14:00:29	@jfredett	but which incorporates combined arms more thoroughly
2013-08-12 14:00:34	@jfredett	and larger play areas
2013-08-12 14:02:22	SirSkidmore	jfredett: you can user in an era of not-shitty only board games :)

2013-08-12 14:02:51	SirSkidmore	shitt
2013-08-12 14:02:57	SirSkidmore	I meant online >.>
2013-08-12 14:03:57	@jfredett	heh
2013-08-12 14:07:11	SirSkidmore	I guess roll20 is doing a pretty decent job
2013-08-12 14:07:14	@jfredett	yah
2013-08-12 14:07:18	@jfredett	I like 'em
2013-08-12 14:07:33	SirSkidmore	I haven't gotten to use it though
2013-08-12 14:07:36	SirSkidmore	but it looks neat
2013-08-12 14:19:24	SirSkidmore	so jfredett I'll keep an eye out for your repo
2013-08-12 14:19:38	@jfredett	yah
2013-08-12 14:19:55	@jfredett	I'm talking about different state solutions in #elixir-lang atm
2013-08-12 14:20:03	@jfredett	but I suspect I'll have something up this evening
2013-08-12 14:20:14	SirSkidmore	great
2013-08-12 14:20:31	SirSkidmore	I've been trying to think of a new LPMC project
2013-08-12 14:20:37	SirSkidmore	this will probably be a good one :)
2013-08-12 14:32:48	@jfredett	I should learn how to use mercurial...
2013-08-12 14:37:26	SirSkidmore	I only know git
2013-08-12 14:39:05	@jfredett	me too
2013-08-12 14:39:07	@jfredett	well
2013-08-12 14:39:11	@jfredett	svn technically too
2013-08-12 14:39:30	@jfredett	but that's my primary motivation for learning hg — because I only know git
2013-08-12 14:42:23	expez	darcs!
2013-08-12 14:43:42	@jfredett	expez: I know a bit of darcs
2013-08-12 14:43:44	@jfredett	didn't care for it
2013-08-12 14:43:50	expez	oh?
2013-08-12 14:43:55	expez	sounds kind of neat to me
2013-08-12 14:44:12	@jfredett	it's very much a VCS as conceived by a chronic academic
2013-08-12 14:44:20	@jfredett	it's not strictly 'bad'
2013-08-12 14:44:20	expez	actually think everyone should just come git though.  It works so well it's hard to make an argument for more tool fragmentation.
2013-08-12 14:44:32	@jfredett	just… not as useful as git
2013-08-12 14:44:36	expez	github is another reason to just get everyone on board
2013-08-12 14:44:40	@jfredett	it's operating at the wrong resolution
2013-08-12 14:44:44	@jfredett	expez: *nod*
2013-08-12 14:44:49	@jfredett	i think a little competition is nice
2013-08-12 14:45:09	@jfredett	and much of the world is either hg or git, and they talk to each other pretty okay
2013-08-12 14:45:18	expez	yeah
2013-08-12 14:46:24	expez	does every language need it's own package manager and build tool?
2013-08-12 14:46:47	expez	Didn't everyone use make for everything a while back?
2013-08-12 14:47:09	@jfredett	expez: well
2013-08-12 14:47:11	@jfredett	the issue is that
2013-08-12 14:47:13	@jfredett	make sucks
2013-08-12 14:47:20	expez	certainly it does
2013-08-12 14:47:34	expez	but having n build tools for n languages seems bad too
2013-08-12 14:47:38	@jfredett	I think however that every peice of an architecture does some punctuated equilibrium
2013-08-12 14:47:43	@jfredett	explosion of alternatives
2013-08-12 14:47:50	@jfredett	selection of the fittest
2013-08-12 14:47:53	@jfredett	rinse
2013-08-12 14:47:54	@jfredett	repeat
2013-08-12 14:48:06	expez	I tried to use grunt yesterday
2013-08-12 14:48:14	expez	why would anyone use a build tool written in js? :P
2013-08-12 14:48:46	@jfredett	expez: I have no idea
2013-08-12 14:48:55	@jfredett	i have no idea how JS has managed to survive this long
2013-08-12 14:48:59	@jfredett	except by sheer pluck
2013-08-12 14:49:00	expez	The reason I came up with is that tons of people only know 1 or two languages and if they write the tool in that language they might get patches
2013-08-12 14:49:22	expez	js is a classic worse is better example
2013-08-12 14:49:44	expez	it'll probably be OK in another couple of language versions
2013-08-12 14:49:56	@jfredett	js is a classic worse is way fucking worse example.
2013-08-12 14:50:04	 *	jfredett doesn't like javascript much
2013-08-12 14:50:52	expez	trying to get into web dev atm :P
2013-08-12 14:51:08	expez	worked my way through javascript the good parts, so I only really know a (tiny?) subset of js
2013-08-12 14:51:29	@jfredett	I have a theory
2013-08-12 14:51:42	@jfredett	if your language needs a book which tells people not to use the vast majority of your language
2013-08-12 14:51:49	@jfredett	you should stop writing languages.
2013-08-12 14:52:06	expez	jfredett: Eich write scheme first, that's what he wanted
2013-08-12 14:52:20	expez	then the suits wanted to get in on the Java hype and told him to make it 'look like Java'
2013-08-12 14:52:22	expez	so he did
2013-08-12 14:52:29	@jfredett	I would be pretty okay w/ scheme — fucking suits.
2013-08-12 14:52:44	expez	that he managed to make a bastard language like that and ship it all in a week is pretty impressive
2013-08-12 14:53:12	expez	fucking disaster nevertheless with what would be considered bugs anywhere else now being part of the standard :D
2013-08-12 14:54:42	expez	anyway, already think the browser environment is cool as shit despite javascripts failings
2013-08-12 14:55:35	@jfredett	expez: it's a neat idea
2013-08-12 14:55:57	@jfredett	though I think a lot of people are overselling it in a lot of cases
2013-08-12 14:56:07	expez	the browser?
2013-08-12 14:56:17	@jfredett	people seem to run back and forth between extremes in the long history of application development
2013-08-12 14:56:20	@jfredett	expez: yah
2013-08-12 14:56:40	expez	the browser is becoming more and more like an OS
2013-08-12 14:56:42	@jfredett	every 10 years or so we're at one extreme or the other, "Thick client, thin Server" is the cry of the moment
2013-08-12 14:57:01	@jfredett	but not even 10 years ago is was all about "thin client, thick server"
2013-08-12 14:57:13	expez	yeah
2013-08-12 14:57:19	@jfredett	and 10 before that (with the advent of the PC) we were talking about thick clients again
2013-08-12 14:57:28	expez	yeah, was about to say
2013-08-12 14:57:36	@jfredett	and 10 before that, Multi-user systems / mainframe-terminal architecture
2013-08-12 14:57:47	@jfredett	and so on and so on
2013-08-12 14:57:59	@jfredett	People need to understand that it's all about the middle way
2013-08-12 14:58:06	@jfredett	if you want to build the 50 year app
2013-08-12 14:58:19	@jfredett	look at google — they started almost 20 years ago (95, iirc)
2013-08-12 15:00:31	@jfredett	they've tread the middle ground, meshing heavier client features as they came available
2013-08-12 15:00:44	@jfredett	but never committing fully, just benefiting at each stage
2013-08-12 15:01:11	expez	yeah
2013-08-12 15:01:18	expez	heard some good engineers work over there :)
2013-08-12 15:01:27	@jfredett	yah
2013-08-12 15:01:27	@jfredett	I dunno
2013-08-12 15:01:50	@jfredett	I've been thinking about it a lot lately — App development is really just a two-dimensional prisoners dilemma
2013-08-12 15:01:54	@jfredett	minimize risk and cost
2013-08-12 15:01:57	@jfredett	for both you
2013-08-12 15:02:03	@jfredett	and the guy who has to maintain it in 5 years
2013-08-12 15:02:15	@jfredett	and really at any time `t` in the future
2013-08-12 15:02:39	@jfredett	that is a hard problem, and illustrates the need for foresight
2013-08-12 15:02:54	@jfredett	a lot of people have the mentality, "Oh, I should just only ever deal with the immediate problem"
2013-08-12 15:03:14	@jfredett	but then they fail to consider the long game
2013-08-12 15:11:28	expez	wonder if that is because they are working for someone else, and don't feel ownership, or because that's just how most people are
2013-08-12 15:11:57	@jfredett	well
2013-08-12 15:11:57	@jfredett	in the case of my boss
2013-08-12 15:11:58	@jfredett	it's because he's a contractor
2013-08-12 15:12:02	@jfredett	and it's job security
2013-08-12 15:12:03	expez	there's also the point that people are making decisions that don't directly affect them
2013-08-12 15:12:07	@jfredett	in the case of others
2013-08-12 15:12:08	@jfredett	it's dogma

2013-08-12 20:19:48	SirSkidmore	I'm building a pebble-controller arduino-powered lamp
2013-08-12 20:20:10	Enalicho	Isn't that the Erlang-based language?
2013-08-12 20:20:20	Enalicho	What differences does it have to Erlang?
2013-08-12 20:20:29	Enalicho	That's cool
2013-08-12 20:20:50	Enalicho	Have you guys played with a Rift yet?

2013-08-12 20:21:19	SirSkidmore	Enalicho: it's very different
2013-08-12 20:21:23	SirSkidmore	It's not Erlang based

2013-08-12 20:29:28	Enalicho	I've been playing with the Rift a bit. Interesting to see how somethings work great with it (bungee jumps, stuff with little detail but a good basic outline) versus things which are nicely created and pretty (like proper buildings, flowers up close, etc)

2013-08-12 20:56:20	SirSkidmore	so it's mostly just fixing old computers

2013-08-12 21:18:40	jfredett-w	lots of ways to be wrong (have no information / be noise)
2013-08-12 21:18:45	jfredett-w	few ways to be right
2013-08-12 21:18:55	jfredett-w	so probabilistically, I will be wrong in many ways

2013-08-12 21:19:12	jfredett-w	so say more things, asymptotically
2013-08-12 21:19:26	jfredett-w	only the right stuff will be present

2013-08-13 09:14:28	zachmassia	I'm pretty sure someone here linked me their colors to use with a solarized theme, but with the default black background colors it's horrible

2013-08-13 09:15:01	SirSkidmore	I didn't modify it at all
2013-08-13 09:15:20	SirSkidmore	and all of the nicks are various shades of, well, grey :)

2013-08-13 09:40:14	@jfredett	AFAIK, the main reason for the intermediate representation is run-time optimization via JIT, as well as AOT optimization with what might be termed a 'forgiving architecture

2013-08-14 10:10:37	SirSkidmore	so recursion ends when a condition is met, so jfredett how would I tell Elixir that there is no end condition
2013-08-14 10:10:44	SirSkidmore	and to just keep runnign?
2013-08-14 10:11:17	tangentstorm	just do a tail call with no condition.
2013-08-14 10:11:56	tangentstorm	erlang will optimize the tail calls into a loop

2013-08-14 10:12:55	@jfredett	you might set that up as a gen_server, SirSkidmore — but basically you want to start an actor that waits for either a 'go do a thing' message or a 'stop' message

2013-08-14 15:20:46	@jfredett	it's not percentage — it's philosophy. He has the notion that testing is a way to ensure code is correct
2013-08-14 15:20:59	@jfredett	couldn't be further from the truth
2013-08-14 15:21:13	@jfredett	testing is to make sure you understand what code is _supposed_ to be doing
2013-08-14 15:21:14	@jfredett	it's the moral equivalent of stating your assumptions in a proof
2013-08-14 15:21:46	@jfredett	he (rightly) doesn't see much value in tests for testing code correctness

2013-08-14 15:22:36	@jfredett	but they're not supposed to, so it's like saying, "You shouldn't bother buying a boat because it can't drive on the highway"

2013-08-18 22:45:48	SirSkidmore	I know
2013-08-18 22:45:49	@jfredett	just learn to take showers at night
2013-08-18 22:45:54	SirSkidmore	blehh
2013-08-18 22:46:01	SirSkidmore	I don't like taking showers at night
2013-08-18 22:46:12	@jfredett	I still take showers at night, tbh, much more convenient
2013-08-18 22:46:32	@jfredett	just water on the face in the morning, then right out the door. No rushing.
2013-08-18 22:49:53	SirSkidmore	my hair gets all greasy
2013-08-18 22:50:18	@jfredett	btw, I came up with a lovely problem for us to solve with our once-and-future neural net thing, as well as some ideas for innovations with training. The former — Given an word, tell us the language, part of speech, declension/conjugation as appropriate.
2013-08-18 22:50:31	@jfredett	pretty much any dictionary will work as a corpus to train on
2013-08-18 22:50:43	@jfredett	the latter is an asynchronous semi-online learning procedure
2013-08-18 22:51:11	@jfredett	IE, leveraging the actor model to train and update (and, ostensibly, use) the net concurrently.
2013-08-18 22:51:46	@jfredett	That, btw, would be worth writing a paper on, I think — I haven't done any research into how much literature there is on doing that sort of concurrent training
2013-08-18 22:52:15	@jfredett	but if the idea pans out
2013-08-18 22:52:25	@jfredett	it would be academically viable, as they say
2013-08-18 23:00:26	SirSkidmore	that sounds really great
2013-08-18 23:01:55	@jfredett	yah, it occured to me as I was watching the lecture about computing error derivatives.
2013-08-18 23:02:33	@jfredett	and in particular, managing a large (and I'm talking _very_ large) distributed net in the sort of 'traditional' sense of matrices and the like is unlikely to work with the normal method
2013-08-18 23:03:15	@jfredett	but representing neurons as small clusters of actors should give us the abiliity to do fully concurrent querying and training.
2013-08-18 23:04:45	@jfredett	it basically just boils down to using some sort of coordination mechanism to know when to 'update' the whole net, and managing two separate weights — keep the 'future' one ready, when you receive the update signal you flush all your query / trains out on the old weight, update, and send a 'done' to some manage
2013-08-18 23:04:45	@jfredett	r
2013-08-18 23:05:00	@jfredett	or cluster thereof.
2013-08-18 23:05:21	@jfredett	SirSkidmore: I also had a crazy idea about using a neural net to train to choose neural nets
2013-08-18 23:05:32	SirSkidmore	omg
2013-08-18 23:05:32	@jfredett	ie, you train a bunch of little neural nets to solve specific problems
2013-08-18 23:05:34	SirSkidmore	let's do it
2013-08-18 23:05:40	@jfredett	and then train one
2013-08-18 23:05:44	SirSkidmore	I really want to start working on this :P
2013-08-18 23:05:44	@jfredett	to choose the right net
2013-08-18 23:05:57	@jfredett	SirSkidmore: that idea is based on the 'chunking' theory of learning
2013-08-18 23:06:23	@jfredett	SirSkidmore: I have to get through the rest of these lectures, in particular I also want to review some of the existing research and figure out existing implementation strategies
2013-08-18 23:06:34	@jfredett	some of what I thought I think might be wrong-ish
2013-08-18 23:07:42	@jfredett	but I'd *really* like to see the multi-net approach, the implementation is actually really simple — given an input vector of `k` bits, and an output vector of `n*k` bits, output the input to one of `n` neural nets
2013-08-18 23:07:50	@jfredett	which are just connected in series
2013-08-18 23:08:24	@jfredett	so to use the lingo — the first net needs to identify characteristics of problem data that determine the *type of problem*
2013-08-18 23:08:33	@jfredett	and the latter to solve that problem
2013-08-18 23:08:54	@jfredett	if we could get something like that "working" for some definition of "working"
2013-08-18 23:09:49	@jfredett	that would be awesome.
2013-08-18 23:18:57	SirSkidmore	jfredett: when do we start?
2013-08-18 23:20:49	@jfredett	uh… I'm on lecture 5
2013-08-18 23:21:02	@jfredett	and I haven't gathered literature on this stuff yet

2013-08-18 23:21:52	@jfredett	sooner or later you're talking about real mathematics.

2013-08-22 13:14:14	zachmassia	[bootstrap3] Is there a way to have a list-group's width scale according to the longest element?
2013-08-22 13:27:59	@jfredett	width=x%?
2013-08-22 13:37:54	zachmassia	I guess I could just find the longest string and set it to that, was wondering if there was some way to have it automatically adjust
2013-08-22 13:39:19	@jfredett	zachmassia: iirc, if you set width=100% on the containing element, it'll try to fill as much space in the outer div as you can
2013-08-22 13:40:01	@jfredett	I imagine that — practically, you have a <x> with a bunch of <y>'s in it
2013-08-22 13:40:10	@jfredett	so set the <x> to the desired width (absolute or otherwise)
2013-08-22 13:40:17	@jfredett	then make each <y> have width 100%
2013-08-22 13:40:26	@jfredett	it *should* fill up to the outer element
2013-08-22 13:40:41	@jfredett	but I am not a CSS whizbanger, so take that with a grain of salt
2013-08-22 13:53:25	zachmassia	Hmm.. I think I may just let it fill the width of it's parent div, once I add more stuff to the page it won't be as wide

2013-08-22 21:28:22	zachmassia	For those of you who do web development, what was your first kind of real app you made
2013-08-22 21:29:02	zachmassia	I'm thinking I want to make something to organize the different internet radio streams I listen to
2013-08-22 21:31:29	zachmassia	But from looking around it seems that it's kind of a pain to get js players to play nice with shoutcast servers (and flash is worse because it doesn't delete the stream data until it closes)
2013-08-22 21:52:52	tangentstorm	hrm. what was the first web app i made? beats me. probably just a cms for my website.
2013-08-22 21:54:12	tangentstorm	i made an app that would read text, translate it into another language via babelfish, and then render it as an audio file through some text-to-speech system i found online.
2013-08-22 21:54:29	tangentstorm	something ibm had on their site i think.
2013-08-22 21:57:59	zachmassia	Neat, that sounds like a fun little project
2013-08-22 22:00:41	zachmassia	Oh I just thought of something that could be fun: Some kind of interface to github.com/meenie/8bit.js

2013-08-22 22:28:39	zachmassia	Would be pretty cool. 8bit.js is simple enough for now too so you don't have a million settings to provide menus for
2013-08-22 22:29:11	zachmassia	I might wait (or have a look at the source myself) until it supports reading songs from json or something though first
2013-08-22 22:38:47	tangentstorm	well, i think my picolisp implementation of learntris is more or less done... at least for a first iteration.
2013-08-22 22:40:12	tangentstorm	so i guess next up is building a website for it.

2013-08-22 23:17:26	zachmassia	Never heard of picolisp before, sounds kind of interesting based on the homepage
2013-08-22 23:21:38	tangentstorm	yeah, it was fun
2013-08-22 23:22:28	tangentstorm	it really strips lisp down to the bare essentials. everything is interpreted, there are no arrays... just symbols, numbers, and cons cells.
2013-08-22 23:25:49	zachmassia	Seems like it might be an easier way to get into lisp. I don't mind the syntax, just not used to the lisp way of doing things
2013-08-22 23:26:32	tangentstorm	yeah.. it really took a shift in thinking for me.
2013-08-22 23:27:31	tangentstorm	like i started out using lists of lists to simulate 2d arrays
2013-08-22 23:28:35	tangentstorm	but by the end i found myself using a list of  (x y value)  lists
2013-08-22 23:28:39	tangentstorm	https://github.com/tangentstorm/learntris/blob/picolisp-nudge-work/learntris.l#L153
2013-08-22 23:29:03	tangentstorm	almost everything became much much easier with that format
2013-08-22 23:30:25	tangentstorm	so right now, most of my routines call this (pic->xyvs) conversion routine... i need to refactor the thing so that the data is all stored in that format to begin with.
2013-08-22 23:31:57	SirSkidmore	hey
2013-08-22 23:32:13	SirSkidmore	So there are some really cool people on my floor
2013-08-22 23:32:13	SirSkidmore	haha
2013-08-22 23:32:19	zachmassia	Ya that seems a little easier to work with.
2013-08-22 23:32:33	 *	zachmassia thinks learntris in Go would be cool
2013-08-22 23:35:25	tangentstorm	:)
2013-08-22 23:35:34	tangentstorm	the tests are pretty usable now
2013-08-22 23:35:46	tangentstorm	SirSkidmore: maybe you need furniture? ;)
2013-08-22 23:36:05	tangentstorm	i also wrote a little console mode interactive viewer/debugger thing
2013-08-22 23:36:26	tangentstorm	http://i.imgur.com/n2lwgbg.png
2013-08-22 23:37:27	tangentstorm	you type to build up the string of events at the bottom and it just sends those to your implementation, adds a "print" command, and colorizes the result

2013-08-22 23:39:29	zachmassia	So the line at the bottom is what moves the blocks?
2013-08-22 23:39:45	tangentstorm	yeah
2013-08-22 23:40:18	tangentstorm	there's no randomness, and by default it spawns a T tetramino.
2013-08-22 23:40:37	tangentstorm	so <<<V presses left three times and then down.
2013-08-22 23:40:59	tangentstorm	well... v moves down one space and V is the hard drop.
2013-08-22 23:41:14	tangentstorm	then Z gives you the red tetramino
2013-08-22 23:41:21	zachmassia	Ahh, that makes much more sense now
2013-08-22 23:41:24	tangentstorm	etc.
2013-08-22 23:41:36	zachmassia	I was trying to make sense of what each char did lol
2013-08-22 23:41:49	tangentstorm	it looks ugly but when you're typing it out it's just immediate and you don't really even have to look at it.
2013-08-22 23:42:21	tangentstorm	in the tests, everything is limited to just a few commands and the're formatted nicely
2013-08-22 23:42:38	tangentstorm	so hopefully it's actually readable :)
2013-08-22 23:43:58	tangentstorm	( and ) rotate anti-clockwise and clockwise, respectively.
2013-08-22 23:44:07	zachmassia	At first I was trying to map them to a wasd style control scheme so it made no sense :P
2013-08-22 23:44:22	SirSkidmore	tangentstorm: more furniture?
2013-08-22 23:44:23	SirSkidmore	what?
2013-08-22 23:44:48	tangentstorm	SirSkidmore: it was a dumb joke.
2013-08-22 23:45:42	zachmassia	Very cool, I think I'll try and make a Go version soon, moving next week and then starting school so my free time is about to drop drastically though :(
2013-08-22 23:46:25	tangentstorm	yeah i guess i timed it pretty poorly if i wanted to reach the college crowd :)
2013-08-23 00:04:58	@jfredett	SirSkidmore: the joke was that you have a lot of cool people on your floor — as in, your _actual_ floor

2013-09-02 21:11:12	SirSkidmore	me too :)
2013-09-02 21:16:30	jfredett-w	SirSkidmore: yah
2013-09-02 21:16:36	jfredett-w	I have a hacky setup atm though
2013-09-02 21:16:43	jfredett-w	i don't really know lua
2013-09-02 21:16:49	jfredett-w	but I want to make it a bit more modal
2013-09-02 21:18:16	SirSkidmore	jfredett-w: The defaults were pretty darn good I thought
2013-09-02 21:18:29	SirSkidmore	so I haven't made many modifications yet
2013-09-02 21:18:29	jfredett-w	yah
2013-09-02 21:18:34	jfredett-w	I don't mind them
2013-09-02 21:18:47	SirSkidmore	more usable than Haskel
2013-09-02 21:18:48	jfredett-w	but there's a lot of them, and the mnemonics are not great
2013-09-02 21:18:56	SirSkidmore	s/Haskel/Xmonad/
2013-09-02 21:18:56	tamper	SirSkidmore actually meant: more usable than Xmonad
2013-09-02 21:19:03	jfredett-w	xmonad was similar, I thought
2013-09-02 21:19:13	jfredett-w	the problem was that xmonad was built by people who write haskell
2013-09-02 21:19:23	jfredett-w	so they were optimizing for academic neatness factor
2013-09-02 21:19:31	jfredett-w	not usability
2013-09-02 21:19:36	jfredett-w	or, for that matter, customizability
2013-09-02 21:20:10	jfredett-w	I spent a couple afternoon's last week talking with one of our clients about usability
2013-09-02 21:20:24	jfredett-w	well, moreso about 'what usability means for a developer'
2013-09-02 21:20:57	jfredett-w	he's very good at knowing what users need even when they don't, and we concluded some key features of the problem of developing code -- a lot of it seems obvious in retrospec
2013-09-02 21:20:58	jfredett-w	t
2013-09-02 21:21:30	jfredett-w	but stuff like noticing that writing code is highly IO bound -- ie, it's not knowing what information you need
2013-09-02 21:21:36	jfredett-w	it's getting it in front of your face
2013-09-02 21:21:56	jfredett-w	so interfaces that minimize stuff like wasted space or keystrokes tend to 'win'
2013-09-02 21:22:04	jfredett-w	even if they're less pretty
2013-09-02 21:22:44	jfredett-w	gave me some perspective on how to approach things, in any case. sort of a new language for talking about the problem of usability for developers.

2013-09-03 21:06:14	tangentstorm	i think that since i want my pascal dialect to be extensible, i'm going to start by writing a small language with pascal semantics but lisplike syntax.
2013-09-03 21:06:38	tangentstorm	then i'll port my combinators over to that language.

2013-09-04 21:02:13	tangentstorm	never tried it, zachmassia... but linux runs pretty well under windows with virtualbox + desktop integration.

2013-09-04 21:08:08	tangentstorm	worked fine for me when i tried it
2013-09-04 21:08:20	tangentstorm	i was impressed
2013-09-04 21:08:45	zachmassia	Hmm, what distro did you try? I'm thinking Arch might not be a good choice for a vm
2013-09-04 21:09:16	zachmassia	I mean, it's fine if you keep up on updates, but after a few months trying to run pacman -Syu can be risky lol

2013-09-04 21:10:56	zachmassia	I wouldn't bother with a vm and just use windows, but npm was being fussy (playing around with angularjs)
