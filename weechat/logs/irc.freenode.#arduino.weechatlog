2012-12-23 20:36:12	froggyman	but, I'll probably be moving it to my TI stellaris launchpad soon
2012-12-23 20:36:12	UnaClocker	Should step up to an ARM.. Like a Teensy3.. Lotsa SRAM and flash, very very fast.. Cheaper than an Uno.
2012-12-23 20:36:12	froggyman	mmmm... 32bit processor, with a FPU

2012-12-23 20:38:34	froggyman	it's a bit faster
2012-12-23 20:38:34	_BJFreeman	the arduino lanquage takes a lot of stack space and clock cycles

2013-02-17 13:04:28	Malinuss	ecips, I didn't quiet get it, so you don't run the transmitter on batteries?

2013-02-17 13:05:18	ecips	The weather station has rechargeable batteries and a solar panel
2013-02-17 13:05:44	Malinuss	ecips, wow that's cool. You don't happen to have it documented/pictures?
2013-02-17 13:06:42	ecips	The weather station is a commercial product.
2013-02-17 13:06:55	timthelion	gonffen: if the soul is just a mental construct, then how do solar panels work?
2013-02-17 13:07:04	ecips	I bought it off ebay - it had a broken control panel/receiver
2013-02-17 13:07:18	ecips	so I implemented that side of things using the arduino

2013-02-17 18:34:47	desk_busy	yeah, wasnt my first guess, but i finally found it
2013-02-17 18:34:59	desk_busy	i should get parts tomorrow for it too, since i ordered too late on thursday lol
2013-02-17 18:35:16	desk_busy	but i tested it up to a 2a measured and its holding up fine
2013-02-17 18:35:31	desk_busy	with both fets and the real heatsink and all, should be just right
2013-02-17 18:36:01	desk_busy	but precision is going to be quite off at low loads, so I think I'll either make another one for low loads or just have some "range switch" on this crap

2013-02-17 18:37:16	karlmag	well.. if you blow it up, it should end it :-P
2013-02-17 18:37:23	desk_busy	karlmag, just how many op-amps and fets do you think i blew before i figured it out ? :P
2013-02-17 18:37:56	desk_busy	and thats also another reason why you shouldnt use a pc power supply
2013-02-17 18:38:09	karlmag	heh
2013-02-17 18:38:10	karlmag	I've heard they need some load to get stability
2013-02-17 18:38:35	desk_busy	most of them are fine with the fan as the load, but that wasnt it
2013-02-17 18:38:54	karlmag	that's not what I've heard
2013-02-17 18:39:02	desk_busy	when it was blowing, the fets were shorting, so the PSU protection was kicking in bulleye
2013-02-17 18:39:07	karlmag	well, it can work, but...
2013-02-17 18:39:09	desk_busy	karlmag, depends on the psu probably
2013-02-17 18:39:13	karlmag	that too
2013-02-17 18:39:37	karlmag	I read somewhere that some won't even turn on unless they had a load of at least 20W

2013-02-17 18:44:00	karlmag	making errors is usually a part of learning
2013-02-17 18:44:29	desk_busy	but still had to get ripped of by the local shop since i blew my last one and missed the order cut off time thursday..
2013-02-17 18:44:29	desk_busy	1.25$ , damn thieves...
2013-02-17 18:44:30	desk_busy	lol
2013-02-17 18:44:45	karlmag	for what?
2013-02-17 18:44:50	desk_busy	lm324
2013-02-17 18:45:19	desk_busy	only on my way back did I see some boards that had 2 of them for 99cents, by then I was in "fuck it" mode
2013-02-17 18:45:19	desk_busy	lol
2013-02-17 18:45:33	karlmag	alex10791: when you compile the code there will be generated a file with the bitcode that gets uploaded to the arduino
2013-02-17 18:46:29	karlmag	I guess that's about $1.06 more than you could have gotten away with
2013-02-17 18:46:30	karlmag	:-P
2013-02-17 18:46:54	 *	karlmag mumbles something about stocking up
2013-02-17 18:47:00	alex10791	karlmag: my problem is that I think I have lost my code so I can't compile again. I hoped that there would be some way I could download it from the arduino
2013-02-17 18:47:14	desk_busy	i had stocked up for fuck sakes, I blew them all :P
2013-02-17 18:47:28	karlmag	desk_busy: not enough then I guess :-P
2013-02-17 18:47:43	karlmag	how many did you blow btw?
2013-02-17 18:47:46	desk_busy	5 or 6, not that bad
2013-02-17 18:48:02	karlmag	I think I have more of those laying about here somewhere
2013-02-17 18:48:15	desk_busy	i will tomorrow heheh :)
2013-02-17 18:48:20	karlmag	then again.. I would probably manage to blow all I have of something too at some point
2013-02-17 18:48:28	karlmag	hehe
2013-02-17 18:48:33	desk_busy	gotta do a futurlec order too, i keep losing my damn cart, takes ages to do again
2013-02-17 18:49:43	karlmag	alex10791: it is/was probably where the code was...   try to search for the same filename.. it might be called the same but with different extension
2013-02-17 18:49:59	karlmag	desk_busy: where else do you shop?

2013-02-17 18:50:13	desk_busy	digikey futurlec and ebay most of the time
2013-02-17 18:50:13	karlmag	been a while since I bought anything from futurlec now
2013-02-17 18:50:28	desk_busy	they are just so cheap...
2013-02-17 18:50:29	desk_busy	lol
2013-02-17 18:50:29	karlmag	SuperBrainAK: that sounds even more expensive :-P
2013-02-17 18:50:43	desk_busy	7seg display on digikey, 7$ something, futurelec 1.50$
2013-02-17 18:50:45	karlmag	desk_busy: you might want to try taydaelectronics.com too then
2013-02-17 18:51:10	SuperBrainAK	well i get the cheap ones ive never gotten one over 20$
2013-02-17 18:51:10	desk_busy	karlmag, thanks for the reminder, im sure i have it bookmarked somewhere lol
2013-02-17 18:51:30	desk_busy	i need a 3rd one
2013-02-17 18:51:43	desk_busy	and maybe another after that
2013-02-17 18:51:43	desk_busy	lol
2013-02-17 18:51:46	karlmag	new discount code too today :-)
2013-02-17 18:51:46	desk_busy	it gets tricky!
2013-02-17 18:52:16	karlmag	3rd what?
2013-02-17 18:52:16	SuperBrainAK	i did have a pretty good one but that was a gift, and i never got to use it much because i lost it :/
2013-02-17 18:52:16	alex10791	karlmag: thanks but my poblem is that its been a log time since I made the code and I don't think I can find the directory. I can't even remember what its called. I'll give it a try though

2013-02-17 22:11:02	CMiYC	If the bootloader was crashing your code wouldn't be running

2013-02-17 22:11:21	CMiYC	ALL the bootloader does is start running your code
2013-02-17 22:11:26	CMiYC	something else is the problem

2013-02-17 22:13:01	CMiYC	Your code does not affect the bootloader
2013-02-17 22:13:10	CMiYC	if "something" is "crashing", it isn't the bootloader
2013-02-17 22:13:20	HUDIBRAS	CMiYC, Thanks
2013-02-17 22:14:10	HUDIBRAS	CMiYC, Maybe noise from ESC then?

2013-02-17 22:56:35	 *	Xark notes Google is handy for this stuff (e.g., "513 in binary ="  or "8  / 256 Mhz =" or "1.5 milliseconds in microseconds").
2013-02-17 22:57:02	FergusL	bon sang, how the hell could I still be struggling with such stuff..
2013-02-17 22:57:46	Xark	The devil is in the details. :)
2013-02-17 22:57:46	CMiYC	because binary isn't the way our brains think
2013-02-17 22:57:46	FergusL	Xark: ha sure ! I always use it for distances and currencies but my instant reflex is to run python when I'm in need for prog things
2013-02-17 22:57:47	CMiYC	computers don't have an ego.  humans do

2013-02-17 22:58:18	Xark	FergusL: Yeah, well it now has an "instant answer" thing that is quite handy (with "dropdowns" to convert units etc.)
2013-02-17 22:58:43	Xark	FergusL: I rarely need to launch a web browser (always have one open). :)
2013-02-17 22:59:02	FergusL	of cours... yeah...
2013-02-17 22:59:04	FergusL	I also use "temp <city>" to get the weather

2013-02-17 23:00:48	FergusL	bitshifting isn't even the trickiest concept. binary AND, OR, XOR for manipulating flags is
2013-02-17 23:01:44	sirdancealot7	google cant do bitshifting

2013-02-17 23:03:16	Xark	sirdancealot7:  It doesn't support any "logical" ops (and, or not etc.)
2013-02-17 23:04:04	sirdancealot7	ha
2013-02-17 23:04:54	CMiYC	I'm pretty sure someone at google is aware of bitshifting
2013-02-17 23:05:30	Xark	CMiYC: No doubt, but I suspect those words are more important "overloaded" for search purposes.,
2013-02-17 23:05:31	sirdancealot7	they only shift by petabytes
2013-02-17 23:06:07	Xark	CMiYC: It would be nice if they had some way for logical ops (but I am not aware of it).  Plenty of other web calcs of course...
2013-02-17 23:07:25	CMiYC	Xark: I agree.  With everything else they do, I'm surprised it is missing
2013-02-17 23:09:47	Xark	CMiYC: I found this article way back in 2003 mentioning the limitation -> http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/8/14/21307/5189
