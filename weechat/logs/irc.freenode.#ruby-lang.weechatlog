2012-12-12 23:05:01	drbrain	I hope I can get at least 33 more tests into RDoc
2012-12-12 23:05:07	drbrain	then I'll have 2000!
2012-12-12 23:06:17	zzak	https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/doc/irb/irb.rd everything merged but Restrictions section
2012-12-12 23:06:29	zzak	which seems like it doesnt apply anymore
2012-12-12 23:07:22	zzak	like the bit about local variables and here document not being implemented
2012-12-12 23:07:56	charliesome	zzak: nice work
2012-12-12 23:08:07	drbrain	declaration of local variables shuold always be true in irb
2012-12-12 23:08:21	drbrain	eval "a = 1"; p a # => NameError
2012-12-12 23:08:43	zzak	right, but that doc says it will work
2012-12-12 23:09:13	zzak	Though, the above will successfully done by irb. `eval "foo = 0"; #=> 0; foo #=> 0;
2012-12-12 23:09:34	zzak	i think its wrong
2012-12-12 23:09:37	drbrain	eval "eval %{a = 1}; p a"
2012-12-12 23:09:43	drbrain	also gets NameError
2012-12-12 23:10:14	zzak	which seems to match non-irb
2012-12-12 23:10:29	drbrain	huh
2012-12-12 23:11:14	zzak	they both return NameError
2012-12-12 23:11:19	zzak	ruby and irb
2012-12-12 23:11:24	drbrain	that's nice
2012-12-12 23:11:56	zzak	so doc is saying, that irb wont NameError, which is wrong
2012-12-12 23:12:12	drbrain	yeah
2012-12-12 23:12:20	zzak	that whole chapter should just be removed
2012-12-12 23:12:41	zzak	i couldnt figure out the Symbol bit tho
2012-12-12 23:12:54	zzak	"Irb can not always recognize a symbol as to be Symbol. Concretely, an expression have completed, however Irb regard it as continuation line."
2012-12-12 23:13:12	zzak	any idea how to reproduce that?
2012-12-12 23:13:13	drbrain	that may still be true
2012-12-12 23:13:18	charliesome	yep
2012-12-12 23:13:21	charliesome	[1,2,3].reduce :*
2012-12-12 23:13:24	charliesome	continues in irb
2012-12-12 23:13:37	charliesome	wait
2012-12-12 23:13:41	charliesome	no it doesn't
2012-12-12 23:13:44	charliesome	i swear it used to
2012-12-12 23:14:01	charliesome	ah
2012-12-12 23:14:08	charliesome	:+ continues
2012-12-12 23:14:47	drbrain	I wonder if I worked around that in rdoc
2012-12-12 23:14:58	drbrain	I have fixes irb doesn't and should merge
2012-12-12 23:15:16	drbrain	â€¦ but irb doesn't care about most of my changes :/
2012-12-12 23:15:58	zzak	i dont get it, both those do the same thing in `ruby` and irb
2012-12-12 23:16:18	ryanf	zzak: "[1,2,3].reduce :+" is a complete statement, but irb thinks it isn't
2012-12-12 23:16:20	ryanf	pry, on the other hand...
2012-12-12 23:16:20	zzak	: returns unexpected ':', and :+ returns undefined local variable
2012-12-12 23:16:49	drbrain	"p :+" is a simpler reproduction
2012-12-12 23:17:13	zzak	oh, i see now
2012-12-12 23:17:34	zzak	ruby -e '[1,2,3].reduce :+\n'

2012-12-12 23:28:38	zzak	!
2012-12-12 23:28:38	drbrain	now single files can be properly re-parsed!
2012-12-12 23:28:40	drbrain	rather single C files
2012-12-12 23:29:00	drbrain	previously they didn't know the proper C variable names to hook themselves up
2012-12-12 23:29:04	zzak	oh, you mean the rdoc update bug
2012-12-12 23:29:08	drbrain	yeah
2012-12-12 23:29:11	banisterfiend	drbrain: how does the rdoc C parser compare to the yard one?
2012-12-12 23:29:28	zzak	i always nuke my ./html folder when generating doco
2012-12-12 23:29:29	drbrain	so touch ext/openssl/ossl_x509name.c; make will have all zeros
2012-12-12 23:29:43	drbrain	HTML generation always re-parses everything
2012-12-12 23:29:52	drbrain	banisterfiend: I have no idea, I've never looked at it
2012-12-12 23:30:08	zzak	that is new tho
2012-12-12 23:30:38	zzak	old habits die hard
2012-12-12 23:31:38	drbrain	zzak: I usually make; rdoc --no-standard -d .ext/rdoc Whatever
2012-12-12 23:31:48	drbrain	since the incremental ri build is so much faster
2012-12-12 23:32:38	zzak	i actually dont check the ri
2012-12-12 23:32:58	zzak	am i fired?
2012-12-12 23:33:08	drbrain	no
2012-12-12 23:33:13	drbrain	making sure they're the same is my job :D
2012-12-12 23:33:13	charliesome	parse.y is particularly scary
2012-12-12 23:33:20	charliesome	because it does way more than just parse
2012-12-12 23:33:22	zzak	hurray!

2012-12-13 01:18:50	shachaf	Well, being able to figure out how the WP database works on your own is a test you have to be pass for people to let you do something like that. :-)
2012-12-13 01:19:20	shachaf	Fortunately it's not very hard, and I already gave it away, really.

2012-12-15 01:07:51	zzak	i still havent figured out where Raise comes from
2012-12-15 01:07:52	ryanf	why does e2mm need a special fail method for the classes it produces
2012-12-15 01:08:08	ryanf	couldn't the class just define #message to have a default
2012-12-15 01:08:11	cirwin	dunno
2012-12-15 01:08:17	cirwin	maybe it's not implemented like that :p

2012-12-15 01:10:07	ryanf	I guess it solves some different problems

2012-12-15 01:10:27	cirwin	it's an internationalization moduule
2012-12-15 01:10:37	cirwin	says so at the top :p
2012-12-15 01:10:47	cirwin	wow, each_sublocale is terrifying
2012-12-15 01:11:05	zzak	it hasnt changed much since matz original implementation: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/3db12e8b236ac8f88db8eb4690d10e4a3b8dbcd4/lib/e2mmap.rb

2012-12-15 01:12:30	zzak	like FrameUnderflow/FrameOverflow
2012-12-15 01:12:45	zzak	probably a patch waiting to happen

2012-12-15 01:13:54	zzak	that is all part of it
2012-12-15 01:14:15	cirwin	interesting
2012-12-15 01:14:24	cirwin	pry has a similar thing where inputs can eof and it's all ok
2012-12-15 01:14:32	cirwin	but I can't see the similarity beyond that
2012-12-15 01:15:24	zzak	irb lets you provide a separate context for each io
2012-12-15 01:15:40	zzak	it could be anything that responds to inspect, i think
2012-12-15 01:15:57	cirwin	that's nice and generic :)
2012-12-15 01:16:18	zzak	but i think it prefers Stdio, File or Readline
