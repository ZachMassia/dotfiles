2012-11-29 17:15:58	bedouin	what's the difference?

2012-11-29 17:17:09	shevy	bedouin not sure I see the difference
2012-11-29 17:17:09	shevy	hmm
2012-11-29 17:17:09	shevy	it just uses the new hash syntax
2012-11-29 17:17:27	shevy	so yeah bedouin, for ruby 1.9.3 this should be the same
2012-11-29 17:17:27	shevy	in ruby 1.8.x it would not work

2012-11-29 17:17:48	bedouin	shevy: one guy committed the the 2nd part... which did not compile on another computer
2012-11-29 17:18:31	bedouin	thanks shevy - so this is evolution of ruby (or rails?)
2012-11-29 17:18:31	-->	i_s (~i_s@c-24-5-175-8.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined #ruby
2012-11-29 17:18:42	Hanmac	(because the other computer has shity ruby :D)
2012-11-29 17:18:42	gbchaosmaster	bedouin: The other computer is probably using 1.8, update it.
2012-11-29 17:18:42	flip_digits	is there a way to break a sting up over multiple lines?
2012-11-29 17:19:03	TTilus	flip_digits: just insert newline
2012-11-29 17:19:27	-->	joeycarmello (~joeycarme@17.244.69.224) has joined #ruby
2012-11-29 17:19:27	gbchaosmaster	bedouin: It's an upgrade to Ruby's syntax. When using symbols as keys to a hash, {:a => 1, :b => 2} can become the much nicer {a: 1, b: 2}.
2012-11-29 17:19:27	shevy	bedouin it is a syntax change in ruby, rails influenced a lot of it though, but it was matz's decision

2012-11-29 17:19:42	flip_digits	TTilus thanks
2012-11-29 17:19:42	TTilus	flip_digits: then, of course, you get string with newlines in it
2012-11-29 17:19:52	TTilus	flip_digits: whats the case?
2012-11-29 17:20:07	R3dy	Does ruby have any way to do code signing?
2012-11-29 17:20:09	flip_digits	TTilus I cant have newlines in the string. It's for a url
2012-11-29 17:20:20	TTilus	flip_digits: if you have loads of formatted stuff, you might want to use heredoc
2012-11-29 17:20:21	TTilus	flip_digits: ah, url

2012-11-29 17:20:44	R3dy	maybe it goes by another name.  I'm not getting much luck searching "Ruby Code Signing"
2012-11-29 17:20:44	TTilus	flip_digits: and it is so long you wanna split it?
2012-11-29 17:21:07	flip_digits	TTilus yes ti's more than 80 chars so...
2012-11-29 17:21:11	TTilus	flip_digits: "http://ho.st/stuff/starts" +

There are too many devil-in-the-details differences between zsh and bash when you get down and dirty deep. Thats why I originally left the project because that was the goal. I'm against it and didn't want to work on furthering that direction for RVM. However, since then, I'm told its taking a different avenue, so we'll see.

2012-12-02 15:46:46	rismoney1	not multiple items.
2012-12-02 15:46:52	apeiros_	rismoney1: first you have to define "word"
2012-12-02 15:47:30	apeiros_	but: str[/\p{Word}+/] will extract the first substring containing only word characters

2012-12-11 23:32:57	otherj	is there an easy way to compare an object parameter against a hash and if it matches use the hashe's value to, say, set the value of a different object?
2012-12-11 23:37:24	epwhorl	that sounds deceivingly simple
2012-12-11 23:37:42	otherj	it's what is probably a bad solution to another problem i have
2012-12-11 23:37:50	otherj	but i think it might work if i can figure out how. haven't really used hashes in ruby though

2012-12-11 23:41:42	otherj	oh, ok. that works only if hash only has one value, right?
2012-12-11 23:43:12	waxjar	a Hash has key-value pairs: { 'key' => 'value', 'another_key' => 'value' }
2012-12-11 23:43:20	epwhorl	nope, that searches the entire hash for that key
2012-12-11 23:43:30	otherj	basically i need to have an array with key/value where i have a string and some integer, and when i'm writing a value i need to compare against that array and write the integer value to an order column
2012-12-11 23:43:56	otherj	and the string can be one of like 6 choices
2012-12-11 23:43:56	waxjar	an Array is just a list of objects: [1,2,3,4,5]

2013-02-17 10:18:47	whitequark	why would it be used as a medical drug otherwise? note that you don't get to smoke weed; what you inhale is basically vaporized THC--and pretty pure one.
